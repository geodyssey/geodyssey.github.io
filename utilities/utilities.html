<hr><a name="toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3>

As an aid to the preparation of data for a Hipparchus-based application, a
suite of Hipparchus-based cross-platform command-line utility programs is
provided.<p>

Here are some <a href="#general">general comments</a>.<p>

The <i>Utilities</i> divide into six categories:<ol>

<li><a href="#voronoi">generate and modify Voronoi cell index
structures</a><p>

<li><a href="#transcribe">transcribe lat/long or concise direction cosine
coordinates between ASCII text and packed binary formats</a><p>

<li><a href="#modify">modify and/or check data structures</a><p>

<li><a href="#buildhbo">construct Hipparchus Binary Object (HBO) files</a><p>

<li><a href="#buildplr">construct static point. line or region data
collections (PLR) files</a><p>

<li><a href="#gps">transcribe or generate GPS NMEA sentences.</a><p>

</ol><p>

Here's an <a href="#index">alphabetic index of the <i>Utilities</i></a>.<p>


<hr><a name="general"><h3>General</h3>

<p>The <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> are batch programs written in ANSI C and
distributed in source.  For maximum portability, they employ a simple console
interface implemented using only the <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i> and
<i>stderr</i> facilities of the C language run-time library.
Run-time file I/O is restricted to the stream I/O facilities of C/C++.

<p>Because many of the <i>Utilities</i> write or read binary data elements or
structures, it is essential that the <i>Utilities</i> be compiled and run in
the target computing environment of the application they support.  Otherwise,
differences in machine architecture and compiled structures may render the
results unuseable.

<p>Most of the <i>Utilities</i> call functions of the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary
Library</i> and the <i>Hipparchus Library</i> proper.  Before attempting to
compile the <i>Utilities</i>, the developer should first compile and build a
local <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> for the target application platform
and verify the availability of the <i>Hipparchus Library</i> binaries for
that platform.<p>

Executable copies of the utilities will normally be invoked from a system
console, but note that they may also be invoked from <i>Galileo</i> via the
<i>Shell</i> command.<p>

<hr><a name="interface"><h3>Command-line Interface</h3>

<p>The <i>Utilities</i> share a common command-line interface. Their command
line takes this form:<pre>

  <b>utility-name [options] in-file-name [out-file-name] [options]</b></pre>

<p> where:<ul>

<li><i>in-file-name</i> is the file name of an input stream file, qualified
and/or extended as required<p>

<li><i>out-file-name</i> is an optional file name of an output stream file,
qualified and/or extended as required<p>

<li><i>options</i> are switches used (optionally) to control the
utility process. Options are identified in the command line by a forward
slash ('/') followed by a case-sensitive option code, which in turn may be
followed by additional qualifying information (such as another code or an
auxiliary file name). An equal sign ('=') may optionally separate an option
code from its qualifying information (if any). Options may be given either
before or after the principal input and output file names.<p> </ul>

<p>At run time, <i>Utilities</i> report their usage in response to a command
line specifying no parameters or one specifying the help option ("/h" or
"/?").<p>

<hr><a name="voronoi"><h3>Voronoi Cell Index Generation and Modification</h3>

<p>These <i>Utilities</i> all have to do with the generation and modification
of Voronoi cell structures for use as spatial indexes within the
Hipparchus-based application. Although the application can construct such an
index on the fly, most will employ an index built off-line, using one or more
of these utilies:<ul>

<li><a name="cellwvs"><a name="cellins"><b>cellwvs</b></a> or
<b>cellins</b></a> may be used to create a Voronoi index file from ASCII cell
centerpoints. The binary file produced (commonly identified with the filename
extension .vix) is in a format suitable for reading into an application using
the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> function <i>h0_LoadVix</i>.
(<i>cellwvs</i> is faster than <i>cellins</i> but uses more memory).<p>

<li><a name="cellpts"><b>cellpts</b></a> may be used to extract from a vix
file its cell centerpoints in ASCII format, possibly for cross-platform
conversion. Optionally, these cell centerpoints can be adjusted to define an
index structure in which the cells are somewhat "rounder".  (Rounding can
improve the uniformity of coordinate resolution in some circumstances, and is
therefore generally recommended). Also, cell corner points can be extracted
as additional centerpoints for a new index structure that will include the
original (or adjusted) centerpoints, resulting in a "harmonic" sub-division
having an approximately threefold increase in cell density.<p>

<li><a name="celldns"><b>celldns</b></a> can be used to influence the
sub-division of a Voronoi cell structure using application-related data. The
"densification" is such that the resulting cell structure reflects the
spatial dispersion of the influencing data.  Within practical limits, the
cells of the resulting structure can be densified to accommodate specified
maximum numbers of data elements. An example of such a densified cell
structure is the index for the <i>Georama for Windows</i> USA Atlas
(<i>usaw32.vix</i>). This was densified from the basic <i>isotype.vix</i>
using US county seats as the influencing file.<p>

<li><a name="cluster"><b>cluster</b></a> can be used to construct clusters of
new cell centerpoints at specified locations. These cell clusters may be of
specified territorial extent having cells of a specified approximate radius.
Output is an ASCII file of new cell centerpoints selected in the context of
an existing cell structure and suitable for concatenation with that
structure. (See <i>cellcat</i>, following).<p>

<li><a name="cellcat"><b>cellcat</b></a> is used to concatenate new cell
centerpoints (such as clusters obtained with <i>cluster</i>) with existing
centerpoints. The concatenation (merge) is such that new and existing
centerpoints lying in close proximity are consolidated.<p>

<li><a name="cellord"><b>cellord</b></a> may be used to re-number the cells
of a Voronoi cell structure, beginning with some specified geographical
position and spiralling outward from that location. (Re-ordering can improve
the performance of a Hipparchus-based application and is therefore
recommended following any form of densification).<p>

<li><a name="vix2tix"><b>vix2tix</b></a> may be used to convert a Voronoi cell
structure file from binary to ASCII text format.  The ASCII file produced
(commonly identified with the filename extension .tix) is in a format
suitable for reading into an application using the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary
Library</i> function <i>h0_LoadTix</i>.  An advantage of the ASCII format for
such files is that they are portable across platforms having dissimilar
machine architectures.<p>

<li><a name="vixcrpt"><b>vixcrpt</b></a> may be used to encrypt a Voronoi cell
structure using public-domain Blowfish software modified for thread-safe
applications in the <i>h0</i> section of the <i>Hipparchus Axiliary
Library</i>. This program can also be used to decrypt previously encrypted
.vix files. The <i>Galileo</i> command <i>ReadDecryptVix</i> permits routine
use of .vix files encrypted using <i>vixcrpt</i>. Encrypted .vix files offer
an efficient and moderately secure encryption scheme suitable for high volume
location data.  Since Hipparchus .hbo and .plr location data formats
differentially encode location coordinates within a Voronoi cell structure,
encryption of that component alone offers substantial security.<p>

<li><a name="cellbld"><b>cellbld</b> is a new "smart" custom Voronoi cell
index builder. It provides the application developer with an easy way to
construct application-specific Voronoi indexes.<p>

Before reading this text you should be familiar with Chapter 6 of the
Hipparchus tutorial: <i>Working With Voronoi Cells</i>.<p>

This example assumes that an application has a set of points that
reasonably well mimics the density of all the data in a system.<p>

The process begins by selecting a "starter" set of cell centerpoints
(in this case <i>dodeca04.pts</i>), and a set of points representing the
density of the data (in this case <i>wells.ptz</i>). Note that the density
point coordinate file is expressed in binary concise direction cosines. As it
is read and converted to cell coordinates many times during the execution of
the program, this format makes the process considerably faster.<p>

In a preliminary step, a Voronoi index consisting of about 800 cells
is constructed from a starter index (<i>isotype</i>) - to be used as the
first in a series of gradually densified indexes.<p>

What follows is a number of "densification steps", carried out until
the population of points in any cell is within a given target.
First, the densification file is read and points are deposited in
the cells they belong to. The count of points in each cell is recorded,
as well as the mid-point of all the densification points in that cell.
Each cell with a population above the target is then "split" into two
cells by replacing its center with two new centers, strategically
positioned so that the new cells tend to remain "round", and that the new
cell centers are placed closest to the highest density of the points in
the new cells.<p>

In each of these steps, a check is made for a zero-length edge.
If this condition is discovered, two of the closest diagonally
opposite points (among the four that form a "corner") are "nudged"
closer together. The process is repeated as necessary.<p>

Once the sufficient number of cells is added to reduce the population
in any cell below the target, a number of "final" cell geometry
adjustments are carried out:<p>

First, the cell centers are moved toward the gravity center of the
cell. The purpose of this is to increase the "roundness" of the cells.<p>

Next, cells are checked for a below-minimum edge length, and if such
is found, participating centers are moved closer to each other. This
is done to improve the computational properties of the structure.<p>

Last, the cells are reordered, also in order to improve the computational
properties of the structure.<p>

After a final consistency check, the structure is written to a file.<p>

To learn more, please inspect the source of the cellbld.c source program and
its included components.<p>

To see the program in action, please download the console program
<i>cellbld.exe</i> for Win32 and its two related data files:
<i>dodeca04.pts</i> and <i>wells.ptz</i> (3 MB), then start the program from
a command console with the program and its two data files in your "current
directory". The download is available at <a

 </ul>

<hr><a name="transcribe"><h3>Coordinate Transcription</h3>

<p>This <i>Utility</i> provide for the transcription of point or vertex
latitude-longitude coordinates between ASCII and packed binary formats.
Although most coordinate data will originate in the ASCII format, high volume
vector coordinates often can be more efficiently archived or reprocessed in
packed binary format. Many of the other <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> accept
coordinates in either format.<p><ul>

<li><a name="convert"><b>convert</b> provides for the conversion of
coordinate data between ascii and binary formats of latitude/longitude and
concise direction cosine formats. Coordinate associated data is preserved and
may optionally be converted between intenger and float formats.<p>
</ul>

<hr><a name="modify"><h3>Modify and/or Check Data Structures</h3>

These <i>Utilities</i> provide for the elimination of duplicate or
otherwise unneccessary coordinates within data structures.<ul><p>

<li><a name="duplpts"><b>duplpts</b> is used to eliminate consecutive
duplicate points or vertices from within data objects. Optionally, a
proximity criterion may be specified.<p>

<li><a name="gnrlize"><b>gnrlize</b></a> is used to reduce the number of
vertices in a line set according to the criterion of "corridor width". This
is sometimes called "generalization".  Although the process can be applied to
the boundary rings of regions, its use for this purpose must be tempered by
the possibility that the generalized rings may touch or overlap, producing a
new region that is topologically flawed.<p>

<li><a name="ringchk"><b>ringchk</b> may be used to verify the topological
validity of the individual rings within a region object. This program may be
used to advantage when preparing very large and complex region objects such
as a world coastline object. Following the ring check, the object will still
need to be validated for inter-ring interference or sense violations using
the <i>h7_VerifyRsetBoundary</i> and <i>h7_VerifyRsetTopology</i> functions
of the <i>Hipparchus Library</i> or their manifestations as the
<i>Galileo</i> commands <i>VerifyRsetBoundary</i> and
<i>VerifyRsetTopology</i>.<p>

</ul>

<hr><a name="buildhbo"><h3>Convert Coordinate Data To Hipparchus Binary
Objects</h3>

<p>Objects constructed in the context of a particular Voronoi cell structure
have a precise canonical form in memory, which form is defined by the
constructor functions of the <i>Hipparchus Library</i>, namely
<i>h7_GlobalToPset</i>, <i>h7_GlobalToLset</i> and <i>h7_GlobalToRset</i>.
All elements of an object's canonical form are binary values of type integer,
float or double. Owing to differing machine architectures, such internal
objects clearly are not directly cross-platform portable.<p>

Some operating systems (such as Windows 95/98/2000/XP/NT and many Unix
systems) support memory-mapped file access via their virtual memory manager.
Within such systems an external file that represents a Hipparchus internal
object is known as a Hipparchus Binary Object (HBO). Such objects may be
opened and closed using functions of section <i>h8</i> of the <i>Hipparchus
Auxiliary Library</i>. Once open, an HBO may be accessed by a program just as
if it were memory resident. Any operation permissible in Hipparchus for a
memory object may be carried out on an HBO, via buffers managed by the
operating systems's virtual memory manager. It is not required that such
objects first be fetched into real memory. Therefore, operations on
Hipparchus Binary Objects are not restricted by real memory constraints, and
otherwise complex operations such as region intersections may be carried out
very efficiently.<p>

An application can generate HBO's on the fly (see <i>Galileo</i>).  Another
alternative is to generate them off-line using <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i>.
Three programs are provided for this purpose:<p><ul>

<li><a name="pts2hbo"><a name="lns2hbo"><a name="rgn2hbo"><b>pts2hbo</b></a>,
<b>lns2hbo</b></a> or <b>rgn2hbo</b> may be used to create machine-dependent
Hipparchus Binary Object (HBO) files representing point set, line set or
region objects, respectively.<p>

These programs accept coordinate inputs in either ASCII or packed binary
format, generating HBO files accessible via memory-mapped file facilities of
the operating system (if available). Construction of the HBO file is
always carried out in the context of an application-specific Voronoi
index.<p>

<li>A fourth program, <a name="bldptin"><b>bldptin</b></a> may be used to
construct a global Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) surface from an
existing 3D point set HBO. The point set HBO must be globally distributed
such that all cells contain a modicum of points. A rule of thumb is that the
number of points in the point set be at least an order of magnitude greater
than the number of cells in the associated Voronoi structure. The point TIN
is constructed using point-associated float Z data, such as elevation or
depth. In order to permit efficient cell-by-cell processing or rendering,
artifact points are created along cell boundaries and Z values interpolated
for those artifacts, such that all new resultant triangles adjacent along
cell boundaries are coplanar. This assures that when rendered
hypsographically, or otherwise processed on a cell_by_cell basis, the cell
boundaries disappear (invisibly mended!). Z values may of course represent
attributes other than elevations or depths, for example temperatures,
pressures, electromagnetic field intensities or product sales.<p>

<li>Since not all 3D data sources provide global coverage, and since
the TIN generation process is necessarily global, another program is
provided, <a name="randpts"><b>randpts</b></a>, which may be used in
conjunction with <i>rgnfltr</i> (see below) to supply random geographic
coordinates and arbitrary Z values for otherwise unoccupied cells.
<i>randpts</i> writes a specified number of points to a .pts file, each with
Z values of zero, or some constant integer (with optional fractional part)
and/or the integer point counter and/or a quoted text string. Since the
geographic distribution of such points is more or less evenly globally
distributed, the next step in preparing the TIN is to filter out those random
points that lie within some defining region, retain ("filter in") those
points condidered valid for the TIN, then merge the two filtered files for
presentation to the <i>bldptin</i> process. Filtering out or in can be
accomplished using the <i>rgnfltr</i> utility.<p>

<li><a name="rgnfltr"><b>rgnfltr</b></a> accepts arbitrary point sets in
ASCII .pts format, a filtering region in ASCII .rgn format and control codes
for retaining points that lie either inside the region or outside the region.
(If points are found to be exactly coincident with region boundary ring
vertices, then there is provision to either retain or reject such points).
In any case, points retained by the program are written to an output ASCII
.pts file, together with any point-associated data present in the input point
set. Of course it is imperative that the filter region be previously proven
to be topologically consistent.<p>

<li><a name="hbo2cdc"></a>HBO files may be "unloaded" into ASCII files of
concise direction cosine (CDC) coordinates by use of the <i>hbo2cdc</i>
utility program. CDC coordinate files may optionally be converted to
latitude/longitude formated and carried cross-platform to rebuild an HBO.<p>

<li><a name="dumphbo"></a>HBO files carried across platforms thought
to be compatible may be inspected and tested for usability by use of the
<i>dumphbo</i> utility program, which must of course first be compiled for
the target platform.<p>

</ul>

<hr><a name="buildplr"><h3>Convert Coordinate Data To Hipparchus PLR
Collection Files</h3>

While an HBO is an external file representation of a single Hipparchus
internal object, there exists a demonstrated need for an external
<i>collection</i> of such objects. Such collections may be managed by an
application using the facilities of a formal database manager (DBMS).<p>

Recognizing that the preponderance of such data is unchanging (static), and
to demonstrate the value of the Voronoi tessellation as an efficient spatial
index, a simple yet effective file system is provided via functions of the
<i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> and certain <i>Hipparchus
Utilities</i>.<p>

Known as Hipparchus Point-Line-Region collection files (PLR's), simple stream
I/O files constructed according to the Hipparchus PLR schema may be accessed
efficiently by the Hipparchus-based application to retrieve application
coordinate data in a form immediately useable by the application.  PLR
collections are indexed primarily by the identifiers of the Voronoi cells
that contain (own) the collection's member points or vertices. For line or
region collections, secondary indexing is provided by line or region
identifier. Construction of a PLR collection is always carried out in the
context of an application-specific Voronoi index.<p>

A PLR collection is created using one of these <i>Hipparchus
Utilities</i>:<p><ul>

<li><a name="pts2plr"><b>pts2plr</b> creates a collection of points from
ASCII (or packed binary) latitude-longitude point coordinates. Coordinates
are classified as to their containing (owner) cell, sorted and written as
binary rows of cell local (differential) coordinates. An ordered cell index
provides direct access to those point coordinates owned by each cell. An
arbitrary datum may be associated with each point. This may be an integer, a
float or a file pointer. If text (e.g., a place name) is found to be
associated with a point on input, it can be appended to an associated file
(.dat) and a file pointer to that particular string in the .dat file is
associated directly with the point's coordinates in the PLR itself.<p>

<li><a name="plrdat2"><b>plrdat2</b></a> provides an alternate way to
construct a .dat file to be associated with a point collection PLR.<p>

<li><a name="namendx"><b>namendx</b></a> constructs an alphabetically ordered
index file of text associated with a point collection, each entry of which
provides location coordinates of the item. Examples of these files may be
found in <i>Georama</i>, in which these index files are used to implement the
<i>Gazetteer</i> facility.<p>

<li><a name="lns2plr"><b>lns2plr</b></a> creates a collection of lines from
ASCII (or packed binary) latitude-longitude line vertex coordinates.
Coordinates are converted to cell local (differential) format. An arbitrary
datum (integer, float or file pointer) may be associated with each vertex.
Lines that traverse more than one cell are divided into fragments. Cell
boundary crossings are added as artifact vertices. File pointers to line
coordinates (or line fragment coordinates) are collected and ordered by cell.
Multi-cell line fragments are doubly linked with file pointers.  Access to
lines (or fragments) may be direct by cell or indirect by line, depending on
the application requirements. Lines selected into memory may be converted
into a Hipparchus canonical line set object.<p>

<li><a name="rgn2plr"><b>rgn2plr</b></a> creates a collection of regions from
ASCII (or packed binary) latitude-longitude region boundary ring vertex
coordinates. Coordinates are converted to cell local (differential) format.
An arbitrary datum (integer, float or file pointer) may be associated with
each ring vertex. Rings that traverse more than one cell are divided into
fragments. Cell boundary crossings are added as artifact vertices. Rings (or
ring fragments) are collected and are accessible by cell and by region and
ring identifier.  Access may be by cell or by region, depending on the
application requirements. Individual region components are organized such
that on retrieval into memory they easily can be re-constructed as a
Hipparchus canonical region object. (If the PLR file is also opened for
memory mapping, this can be achieved merely by populating an object header
with the appropriate pointers).<p>

<li><a name="rptarea"><b>rptarea</b></a> reports the area of each region in a
PLR collection of regions.<p>

<li><a name="dumpplr"><b>dumpplr</b></a> permits PLR files carried across
platforms that are thought to be compatible to be inspected and tested for
usability. The <i>dumpplr</i> utility program must of course first be
compiled for the target platform.<p>

</ul>

<hr><a name="gps"><h3>GPS Support</h3>

<p>Several <i>Utilities</i> support the capture or real-time simulation of
GPS receiver interface message traffic. GPS ASCII interface messages (known
as Natianal Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) sentences) may be captured
and converted to ASCII lat/long line sets or may be generated for subsequent
transmission between computers, simulating real-time GPS reception.<p>

Two utilities are provided. They are:<p><ul>

<li><a name="gtr2lns"><b>gtr2lns</b></a> is used to convert ASCII NMEA
sentences captured in a GPS session into an external line set defined by a
set of ASCII lat/long coordinates.<p>

<li><a name="nmeagen"><b>nmeagen</b></a> is used to transmit ASCII NMEA
sentences captured in a GPS session(s) from one machine to another using a
serial I/O adapter, thus simulating the real-time transmission.<p> </ul>

<hr><a name="summary"><h3>Summary</h3>
Hipparchus provides a portable set of batch programs for off-line application
support.  These are supplied in ANSI C language source and are largely
self-documented. They employ a simple console user interface and stream I/O
only. They easily may be modified to pre-process application data existing in
proprietary formats.<p>
