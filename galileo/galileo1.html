<hr> <a name="intro"> <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></a><p>

This publication describes how you can use the <i>Galileo</i> programs in
your Windows computing environment.<p>

The <i>Hipparchus Galileo Guide</i> is intended to be a companion to the
<i>Hipparchus Tutorial</i> publication and is designed for use by computer
application programmers and architects. It is intended to help such people to
understand the scope and power of the Hipparchus geographic software
development tools.  It does not require specific programming skills.
However, some dexterity with the operation of personal computers in the DOS
and Windows operating environments is required.<p>

If you are unfamiliar with the concepts and facilities of <b>Hipparchus,</b>
we recommend that you now invest a few minutes to view the on-line <a
href="overview.html" target="aside">Hipparchus Overview</a>.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> implements most of the functionality of the <i>Hipparchus
Libraries</i>. Geographic objects may be entered or imported, manipulated
using the comprehensive spatial calculus, then displayed, plotted or exported
for use elsewhere. Application developers, GIS instructors and students will
find the interactive functionality ideal for the exploration of GIS
fundamentals.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> can be used to advantage by programmers in developing
prototypes of end-use applications. Customer-specific spatial data can be
introduced and manipulated to produce results representative of those planned
for a finished application.  Occasionally, an end-use application can be
implemented using components of <i>Galileo</i> alone.<p>

The <i>Hipparchus Galileo Guide</i> and its sister publications, the
<i>Hipparchus Utilities Guide</i>, the <i>Hipparchus Georama for Windows
Guide</i> and the <i>Hipparchus Tutorial</i> are components of every
Hipparchus Software Development Kit (SDK) distribution.<p>

This <i>Hipparchus Galileo Guide</i> is the definitive reference describing
the operation of the <i>Galileo</i> program.<p>

If you have not alreay done so, you may want now to download the free Galileo
for Windows executables and data offered at the <a
href="http://www.geodyssey.com/downloads/downloads.html"
target="aside">Geodyssey website</a>.<p>

Please scan this <i>Hipparchus Galileo Guide</i> before attempting to use the
<i>Galileo</i> programs.<p>

<hr><a name="requirements"><h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3></a><p>

To run the supplied <i>Galileo</i> programs in your computing environment,
you will require:<p><ul> <li>an Intel Pentium or equivalent microprocessor
<li>any Microsoft Windows operating system from 98 on up.</ul><p>

<hr><a name="starting"> <h3>GETTING STARTED</h3></a><p>

<i>Galileo</i> is normally copied (unzipped) to a fixed disk in your
computing environment.<p>

If you have downloaded <i>Galileo</i> from the Geodyssey web site, then you
will have received a file named "galileo_basic.exe", a self-extracting zipped
archive.  Installation instructions will have been presented in the web pages
inviting the download.<p>

Following installation, you should see two small text files (readme.txt and
license.txt) and four sub-directories (runw32, scripts, data and temp).
<i>runw32</i> contains the executables, closely-coupled configuration files
and a copy of this <i>Guide</i>. <i>scripts</i> contains the demonstration
scripts. <i>data</i> contains vector data, supplementary voronoi index files
and a few bitmaps. <i>temp</i> is merely a place-holder for transient
objects. You may find it useful to set up desktop shortcuts to
<i>galileo.exe</i>, <i>galileo.html</i> and the <i>scripts</i> and
<i>data</i> folders.<p>

Now is a good time to review the supplied <i>readme</i> and <i>licence</i>
text.<p>

<hr><a name="demos"> <h3>DEMONSTRATION SCRIPTS</h3></a>

For a first test of <i>Galileo</i> in your environment, we suggest that you
run one or more of the supplied <i>Galileo</i> demonstration scripts. These
are text files with the extension <b>.gal</b>. We particularly recommend
running <i>tour.gal</i>, then <i>interact.gal</i>.<p>

You can start <i>Galileo</i> either directly or indirectly by using any of
the Windows processes available.

If you drag and drop a script file onto a <i>Galileo</i> icon, <i>Galileo</i>
will start up and commence operation using that script. Alternatively, you may
find it advantageous to establish <i>Galileo.exe</i> as the opening procedure
for all files of type *.gal, so that when you double-click the icon for a
script file, <i>Galileo</i> will start up using that script.<p>

On start up, <i>Galileo</i> references the initialization file
<b>galileo.gin</b>. This is a simple ASCII text file that you can easily edit
to suit your local requirements.  (It is described fully in the sub-section
<b>Custom Configurations</b>).<p>

By default, <i>Galileo</i> uses command scripts and data contained in the
sub-directory <b>data</b>.

Default path and file addressing is relative to a directory which is the
parent of the directory from which <i>Galileo.exe</i> is executed. (This will
usually be a root directory named <i>galileo</i> containing a sub-directory
named <i>runw32</i>).  However, default path addressing is controlled
entirely by the <i>galileo.gin</i> file. Galileo contains no file references
that assume a specific directory to be "current".<p>

<hr><a name="files"></a> <h3>EXTERNAL FILES</h3>

<i>Galileo</i> assumes an external file system that supports simple ASCII and
binary files accessible using ANSI C/C++ run-time stream I/O facilities.<p>

There are two categories of file types manipulated by <i>Galileo</i>:<ul>
<li>ASCII files (generally cross-platform portable) <li>binary files
(generally NOT cross-platform portable).</ul>

<b>ASCII files</b><p>

These are "flat" files such as <b>scripts</b> and other text files.  They are
generally cross-platform portable, barring only slight differences in line
endings.<p>

Hipparchus objects have a formal definition as ASCII files.  These
are point set, line set and region objects, usually identified by use
of the filename extensions <b>.pts</b>, <b>.lns</b> and <b>.rgn</b>,
respectively. Their form and content are explained in a subsequent section,
<a href="#objects">Object Management</a>.<p>

<b>Binary Files</b><p> These are files such as Voronoi index files
<b>*.vix</b> , Hipparchus binary objects <b>*.hbo</b>, and collections of
points, lines and regions <b>*.plr</b>.  Due to compiled structure alignment
and "big-endian" vs "little-endian" differences between platforms, these
binary files are generally NOT cross-platform portable.  They should be
accessed only on the same platform on which they were created.  (There are
however several exceptions to this rule that are noted in subsequent
sections. For example, the binary bitmap files (<b>*.bmp</b>, <b>*.jpg</b> and
<b>*.png</b>) are generally cross-platform portable).<p>

Three important binary file types are: <ul> <li>Voronoi index files
<li>collections of points, lines and regions <li>Hipparchus
binary objects (memory-mapped). </ul><p>

<u>Voronoi index files</u> are an external form of the binary internal memory
structures used by Hipparchus for spatial indexing.  They are usually
identified by the filename extension <b>.vix</b>. They are described in more
detail in a subsequent section, <a href="#voronoi">Voronoi Index
Management</a>.<p>

<a name="collections"></a> <u>Collections</u> of points, lines and regions
are external binary files containing point, line  or region object vector
data which may be readily accessed for search and/or display purposes. They
are usually identified by the filename extension <b>.plr</b>.<p>

Collections are created from ASCII point, line or region data using the
supplied utilities <i>pts2plr</i>, <i>lns2plr</i> or <i>rgn2plr</i>,
respectively. Collections are created in the context of specific Voronoi
index files. Their contents are recoverable <b>ONLY</b> in the presence of the
Voronoi index used for their creation.  Collection files are NOT PROCESSABLE
in the context of any other Voronoi index.<p>

Collection files have an internal structure that provides primary access to
coordinate data via a binary search of a cell index for the collection.  Each
file has a header, a cell-ordered cell-contents index and a vector data
coordinate pool. In the case of a collection of lines, individual lines are
identified and their cell-appearance fragments linked back-and-forth in the
coordinate pool. In the case of a collection of regions, individual regions
and their boundary rings are identified and indexed. Any line or ring
crossings of cell boundaries are included as "artifact" vertices, mainly for
graphical rendering purposes. Internal linkages are implemented using C/C++
run-time stream I/O file pointer values and integer offsets.<p>

The structures within a collection are defined by the <b>hippdbse.h</b>
header file supplied with the <i>Hipparchus Release 3.4 Source
Materials</i>.<p>

As with regular Hipparchus objects, a datum may be associated with each point
or line or ring vertex coordinate.  This datum may be parsed from the ASCII
source data file, the <b>.pts</b>, <b>.lns</b> or <b>.rgn</b> files, either
as a long unsigned integer or a float value.  It is then associated directly
with the coordinate pair.<p>

Alternatively, coordinate-associated attributes can be separated from the
<b>.plr</b> collection and deposited in a related file, usually bearing the
same root filename and the extension <b>.dat</b>. In this case, the datum
directly associated with each coordinate pair is an offset value for the
related coordinate attribute (relative to the commencement of the <b>.dat</b>
associated file). Attribute text separated into a <b>.dat</b> file can be
further processed by the utility program <i>namendx</i> to produce alphabetic
index files (usually bearing the extension <b>.ndx</b>). A binary search of
one of these files can provide direct entry into its associated collection
file.<p>

Both <i>Galileo</i> and <i>Georama</i> provide access to collections of
points, lines and regions as a source for the search and display of data.
<i>Georama</i> also provides access to collection data via name indexes
("gazetteers") and mouse proximity ("inspectors").<p>

<a name="mmf"></a> <u>Memory-mappable</u> files are used to great advantage
in the Windows (and other) environments.  Memory-mapped files can be
addressed as though present in memory, but in reality are stored externally,
on hard disk. In both <i>Galileo</i> and <i>Georama</i>, they are used to
represent canonical Hipparchus memory objects.  They are usually identified
by the filename extension <b>.hbo</b>, (short for <b>"Hipparchus Binary
Object"</b>).<p>

Hipparchus objects cast as memory-mapped hbo files are limited in size only
by the declared limit to the virtual memory space in the operating system.
Spatial operations such as <i>DeriveRsetCommon</i> ("polygon overlay") can
therefore be carried out on very large objects without regard to real memory
constraints.<p>

Memory-mapped hbo files are bound to the specific Voronoi index present at
the time of their creation.  Memory-mapped hbo files are NOT PROCESSABLE in
the presence of any other Voronoi index.<p>

Memory-mapped hbo files may be created using appropriate <i>Galileo</i>
<i>Import...</i> or <i>Derive...</i> commands or by execution of one of the
supplied stand-alone utilities, <i>pts2hbo</i>, <i>lns2hbo</i>,
<i>rgn2hbo</i> or <i>bldptin</i>.<p>

Memory-mapped HBO files may be converted to ASCII format by use of the
<i>Galileo</i> command <i>ExportObject</i>.<p>

Memory-mapped HBO files are destroyed using the <i>EraseObject</i> command
(or any ordinary Windows file deletion procedure).<p>

<hr><a name="functions"> <h3>PROGRAM FUNCTIONS</h3></a><p>

<a name="general"><h4>General</h4></a><p>

This section of the <i>Guide</i> describes the structure and user interface
of <i>Galileo</i>. It is assumed that you are somewhat familiar with the
general concepts of Hipparchus, as explained in the <a
href="overview.html" target="aside">Hipparchus Overview</a>, the <a
href="tutorial.html" target="aside">Hipparchus Tutorial</a>, or similar
texts.<p>

The <i>Galileo</i> programs were created specifically to illustrate some of
the uses of functions available in the <i>Hipparchus Library</i> and the
<i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i>. They were developed using the
<i>Hipparchus Release 3.4 Development Tools</i> for Intel microprocessors, an
SDK available from Geodyssey (see <a href="licenses.html"
target="aside">Licenses</a>).<p>

<i>Galileo</i> is a programmer's geographic workbench that permits developers
to enter or import and export vector data defining both surface objects and
satellite orbits. Using <i>Galileo</i>, you can derive new objects as spatial
intersections, unions or proximities and prepare screen and hard copy graphic
displays of these objects in the context of latitude/longitude grids,
coastlines and Voronoi cell structures.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> offers the developer an interactive command-line environment
in which various Hipparchus operations can be performed and viewed
interactively. Graphics are displayed "on the fly", so that you can see how
they work. Scripts can be prepared that automate specific sequences of these
commands, as would be required for live or loop demonstrations of the
prototype of an application.<p>

By contrast, <i>Georama</i> is an interactive end-user viewer application
that gives life to a set of Atlases, providing scenes of geographic areas of
interest as well as gazetteers relating place names to maps. In
<i>Georama</i>, graphics are prepared "behind the scenes" and presented only
when complete. <i>Georama</i> can be extended by the end user to provide new
or modified scenes of existing Atlases.  Atlas authors can add new Atlases
without C or C++ programming.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> and <i>Georama</i> are provided as counterpoint examples of
methods that can be used to implement Hipparchus-based applications in a
windowed computing environment. They provide quite different strategies for
the display of geographics. <i>Galileo</i> draws features directly to the
display while <i>Georama</i> draws to a bit map, delaying presentation until
each scene is complete. Also, <i>Georama</i> demonstrates multi-threaded
commputation, permitting the simultaneous thread-safe operation of Hipparchus
components.<p>

<h3>Galileo</h3>

Once initiated, <i>Galileo</i> provides just two windows: a "console" window
and a "map" window. These windows are positioned on your display according to
instructions contained in the initialization file <b>galileo.gin</b> which is
co-located with the executable program <b>galileo.exe</b>.  Of course, within
a session, you can move, re-size or iconize these windows using the regular
Windows methods.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> commands are entered at the cursor in the console window.
Previously entered commands are scrolled upwards within the console
window.<p>

Note: If the console window should be obscured in part or in full by another
window (such as the map window), then on subsequent restoration of the console
window it will NOT be refreshed. The obscured portion of previously executed
(and scrolled) commands may be lost from sight.  This is in contrast to the
map window, in which any portions obscured by other windows will be preserved
and restored when the window again comes into focus.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> commands are published as mixed-case codes.  However, the
command processor also accepts lower-case command codes.  Also, any embedded
underscores within a command code are removed before interpretation.<p> If
you are uncertain of the precise code for the command you want, you may enter
the first few letters of the command, press <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b> and then the
<b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Shift-Tab&gt;</b> keys to scroll through all of
the commands beginning with the first letters entered.  The cursor is
positioned to the right of the command, ready for the possible entry of
additional parameters. (If you repeatedly press the <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b> key
with no first letters entered, you will see the entire repertoire of
commands).<p>

If a command is misspelled or is not yet implemented, a red error message is
displayed.<p>

Most commands require a list of space- or comma-delimited positional
parameters; the list is separated from the command by at least one space. A
question mark ("<b>?</b>") given as the first parameter of a command will
often produce a short reminder list of the parameters specifiable for that
command.<p>

Positional parameters can be space or comma delimited. If a comma is to be
used as a delimiter, it must immediately follow the parameter it delimits,
without intervening spaces.  However, any number of spaces may precede a
parameter. If any parameter is to contain delimiters, you must specify the
parameter as a quoted string (using matched single or double quotes). A null
parameter can be entered using a comma only for that parameter.<p>

You may scroll backwards and forwards through a history of previously issued
commands by use of the <b>&lt;UpArrow&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;DownArrow&gt;</b>
keys.<p>

You may edit any command by use of the <b>&lt;Backspace&gt;</b>,
<b>&lt;Delete&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;LeftArrow&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;RightArrow&gt;</b>,
<b>&lt;Home&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;End&gt;</b> keys.  The default entry mode is
<b>Insert</b>, but <b>Overwrite</b> mode is available. (The
<b>&lt;Insert&gt;</b> key may be used to toggle between Insert and Overwrite
modes). You may cancel the entry of a command at any time by pressing
<b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b>.<p>

File names or icons appearing elsewhere on your desktop may be dragged and
dropped into a command at the cursor.  This ensures accurate references to
files (path, name and extension). This feature alone may make it worthwhile
to open a window displaying the contents of the <b>data</b> directory
(folder). (We like to display the contents of this folder on the right side
of of our display, as a narrow list, sorted by extension type).<p>

Rather than taking commands exclusively from the keyboard, <i>Galileo</i> can
read commands from "script" files. These are simple ASCII text files
containing <i>Galileo</i> commands, one per line. Reading from a script file
can be initiated interactively simply by entering the script name as a command
(without the .gal extension), or explicitly as a parameter of the
<b>Script</b> command. You can also launch <i>Galileo</i> and initiate script
reading by "dragging and dropping" the icon of a script file onto the
<i>Galileo</i> icon (or shortcut).<p>

Empty script lines or script lines beginning with a semi-colon (;) are
ignored by <i>Galileo</i>.  Such lines may be used as script commentary.<p>

Script files may be created or modified using any elementary text editor.
They are normally identified as script files by the use of the filename
extension <b>.gal</b>.

You are encouraged to modify the supplied scripts or create new ones to meet
your own requirements.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> is terminated by a <b>Quit</b> command. This can be embedded
in a script file.<p>

<hr><a name="mouse"> <h4>Mouse Operation</h4></a><p>

Some commands require pointer device (mouse) coordinate input. The mouse
input interface follows these general principles:<p>

Mouse input is acquired via the standard Windows interface. However, for most
spatial data entry operations, <i>Galileo</i> requires that the mouse be
moved some minimum number of pixels from its previously recorded position.
This minimum is defined by the configuration parameter
<b>coincident.pixel.count</b> in <b>galileo.gin</b>.<p>

The mouse is assumed to be a two-button device. Typically, the (logical)
<b>left button</b> will activate the recording of a mouse location while the
(logical) <b>right button</b> reports the current geographical coordinates of
the mouse.<p>

For example, when entering a new object using one of the <b>Enter...</b>
commands, you can point the mouse at specific geographic locations by
"clicking" repeatedly on the right button while positioning the mouse to the
desired position, guided by the latitude and longitude displayed in the
console window.  Once positioned as required, you enter the position by
clicking the left button.<p>

During many mouse data entry operations, two small buttons are displayed in
the upper corners of the field of the map window. These are the <b>[Esc]</b>
and <b>[Done]</b> buttons.<p>

When mouse location entry is performed for multiple elements (for instance
when recording the individual points of a point object), the entry sequence
is terminated by left-clicking on <b>[Done]</b> or by pressing the
<b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b> key.<p>

When the entry is two-tiered (for instance, when recording the vertices of
the lines of a line set or the rings of a region), you signal the end of an
individual line or ring by left-clicking <b>[Done]</b> or by pressing the
<b>&lt;Space&gt;</b> bar or the <b>&lt;+&gt;</b> key. When entering the
ring(s) defining a region, you may alternatively signal the closure of a ring
by clicking within the small circle defining the first vertex of the ring. In
any case, you signal the end of the line/ring set by again clicking the
<b>[Done]</b> or by pressing the <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b> key.<p>

<b>Note:</b> if you are right-handed, you might be interested in the fact
that the "<b>&lt;Grey +&gt;</b>" and "<b>&lt;Grey Enter&gt;</b>" keys on the
right-hand side of the keyboard are equivalent to the regular
<b>&lt;+&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b> keys.<p>

<a name="drag-drawing"> <b>Note:</b> a simple method of "sampling" points or
line/ring vertices "on the fly" is to "drag" the mouse along the desired path
with its (logical) left button depressed.  This is referred to as
<b>"drag-drawing"</b>.<p>

All of the data acquisition commands allow the user to escape from mouse data
entry sequences by clicking on the <b>[Esc]</b> button or by pressing the
<b>&lt;Esc&gt;</b> key.<p>

<a name="rightmousebutton"> <b>Logical right mouse button</b><p>

At any time, clicking the (logical) right button reports the current
geographical position expressed in latitude and longitude with precision
appropriate for the current map scale. In addition, this action reports the
Voronoi cell number containing this position and the leg and cumulative
distances between successive (logical) right clicks. Distances are reported
in units appropriate for the current map scale.  The distance accumulator is
reset at the commencement of a session. It may be cleared at any time by
double-clicking the (logical) right button.<p>


<hr><a name="geographics"> <h4>Geographics</h4></a><p>

This term is used to describe the rich support provided for developers of
applications involving the geographical presentation of data. It must be
emphasized that this support is complementary to that provided by your GUI.
Hipparchus geographic functions mainly provide you with the means to relate
the "round world" to the "flat screen", and vice versa.<p>

Geographic renderings can be made in any one of several display projections:
<ul> <li>Stereographic <li>Gnonomic <li>World-wide Mercator <li>Local
Mercator <li>Conical (Lambert-like) <li>Orthographic <li>World-wide View
(Miller-like)</ul><p>

<a name="projections">

<dl> <dt>Stereographic (<b>stereo</b>)

<dd> This projection can be centered on any point on the globe, including the
poles. Normally, you will use this projection to display local geographic
features.  In practice, the scale can range all the way from very localized
(say 1:1000) to continental (1:50,000,000).<p>

<dt>Gnonomic (<b>gnonomic</b>)

<dd>While in principle the stereographic projection produces less spatial
distortion, in some instances the gnomonic projection can be used to produce
equivalent displays considerably faster. <i>Galileo</i> automatically
interchanges the Stereographic with Gnonomic projection and vice versa,
whenever the scale and window field size cross certain thresholds.<p>

<dt>World-wide Mercator (<b>wwmerc</b>)

<dd>This projection provides a view of the entire surface of the Earth
(excepting the polar regions) using the familiar Mercator projection. The
view is always Equatorial, centered at some specified central meridian
longitude. The scale is set automatically to fill the defined display window.
This program will be of use in any application requiring a single
presentation of a non-polar world situation.<p>

<dt>Local Mercator (<b>mercator</b>)<dd>

This rotatable display projection provides a local view of an area in the
Mercator projection, used most frequently in maritime applications.<p>

<dt>Lambert (<b>conical</b>)

<dd>This display projection approximates the Lambert-1 and Lambert-2 conformal
conic projections, used for example in US NOAA weather charts.<p>

<dt>Orthographic (<b>ortho</b>)

<dd>This is a view of Earth from space, directly above any point on the globe,
including the poles. The view also takes in the surrounding near space,
including any defined satellite orbits. Normally you will use this projection
to provide the "big picture" or to depict satellite orbits in relationship to
the Earth. Typical scales will range from relatively close-in (1:50,000,000)
to far out (1:500,000,000).  Orbital motion is animated from a viewpoint that
is either geo-stationary or inertial.  In the geo-stationary view, the scene
is depicted from above a specific point on the Earth's surface. In the
inertial view, the scene is depicted from a "fixed" point in space, with the
Earth turning beneath.<p>

<dt>World-wide View (<b>wwview</b>)

<dd>This is a world view projection similar to the Miller cylindrical
projection. In this projection, the Poles are projected at a finite distance
from the Equator. The projection is most useful for the depiction of the
paths of satellites in high polar orbits.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> comes with built-in world coastlines at two levels of detail.
In response to the <i>DrawCoast</i> command, one or the other is drawn as
appropriate for the prevailing map scale and projection. This coastline data
is independent of any Voronoi index. <i>DrawCoast</i> is meant only to be
used for orientation purposes when displaying large surface objects or
satellite orbit traces.  Other, more precise coastline data files may be
imported and are displayable using regular object management
commands.  Several of these are supplied.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> works with selectable Voronoi cell structures. This permits
you to associate objects with any Voronoi index and to observe their
relationship to those indexing cell structures.  For example, <i>Galileo</i>
lets you find and display the specific Voronoi cells associated with any
object.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> is capable of producing hard copy graphics on HP-GL/2
compatible devices (see the <i>Galileo</i> <i>Plot...</i> commands). You can
plot the drawings on-line or you can direct the plotter command stream to a
named file for off-line plotting. If you have access to a PCL5-class laser
printer such as the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIP, you can use the printer as
a plotter.<p>

<hr><a name="customizing"> <h4>Custom Configurations</h4></a><p>

The <i>Galileo</i> programs require specific parameters describing your
particular computing environment and preferences.<p>

The stand-alone utility programs require parameters documented as "Usage"
notes, available on execution of the utility program with the <b>/h</b> or
<b>/?</b> switch set. For more details concerning the parameters and
operation of the stand-alone utility programs, you will need to consult the
<a href="utilities.html" target="aside">Hipparchus Utilities
Guide</a> and, if you have the SDK, inspect their source.<p>

For initialization purposes, <i>Galileo</i> references an associated file,
<i>galileo.gin</i>.  This file must be co-located with <b>galileo.exe</b>.
<i>galileo.gin</i> has the same general form and purpose as Windows
<b>.ini</b> files, consisting of ASCII text lines that provide initialization
strings to named parameters.  Empty lines or lines beginning with a
semi-colon ("<b>;</b>") are ignored.<p>

The general format of a <b>*.gin</b> file is:<br><b><pre>
; Comments ...

parameter.name = value1 [value2 ... ]
parameter.name = value1 [value2 ... ]
 ...
 ...
</pre></b>
where:<p>

<dl>
<dt>parameter.name<dd>is the name of an overridable configuration
    parameter (or parameter array)<p>
<dt>=<dd>is a required token (surrounding spaces are optional)<p>
<dt>value1 value2 ...<dd>are individual configuration
    parameter values, space or comma delimited.  If delimiters are to be
    included in the value, you must specify the value within
    matched single or double quotes.<p>
</dl>

You can easily customize the supplied <b>galileo.gin</b> file using a text
editor. For example, two configuration parameters you may wish to change are
the default console and map window configurations set by the parameters
<b>console.position</b> and <b>map.position</b>.

<h4>Error Messages</h4></a><p>

When running the <i>Galileo</i> programs, you may occasionally encounter
error messages. For the most part, these error messages will be
self-explanatory. Some, however, require further explanation.<p>

Error messages of the form "<b>Return Code = x</b>" refer to internal
conditions that may adversely affect the correct execution of the programs.
These are generally <i>Hipparchus Library</i> function return codes set by
the most recent <i>Hipparchus Library</i> function called by the command.<p>

A few of the more common return codes are:<p>

<dl>
<dt><b>-1</b><dd>An empty set has been created.  This can be legitimate for
    a particular application but may give rise to subsequent nonsensical
    results.<p>

<dt><b>+8</b><dd>Out of heap memory.
    The combined requirements for heap memory have exceeded the total
    available to the application.  You may wish to alter the Windows virtual
    memory specification.  If that doesn't work, try next to erase objects on
    the fly, after their last use (ReleaseHpobj. Next, you might reduce the
    resolution or complexity of objects that have significant numbers of
    points or vertices. Next, try using a less complex Voronoi cell
    structure.<p>

<dt><b>+9</b><dd>The Hipparchus Workspace is exhausted.  An operation has
    been attempted that requires more than the amount of memory allocated
    initially from the heap for this use.  This can occur from of an attempt
    to intersect two nearly identical region objects, giving rise to a very
    complex temporary structure in the workspace. It may also be caused by an
    attempt to <i>DisplayArea</i> a complex region. It can also be caused by
    an attempt to create a satellite nadir trace or sensor swath region with
    too high a sampling frequency or duration. You can change the size of the
    Hipparchus Workspace by modifying the <b>work.space.size</b> entry in the
    in the <b>galileo.gin</b> file.<p>

<dt><b>other</b><dd>You have likely attempted an operation using an
    inappropriately empty or otherwise degenerate object, such as
    attempting to intersect an unverified topologically invalid region
    with some other object.<p>

</dl><p>

<a name="errorvalue"></a>
<b>Note:</b> All <i>Galileo</i> commands set a <b>command error</b> value,
which may be interrogated with the <a href="#iferrorlevel">IfErrorlevel</a>
or <a href="#ifnoterrorlevel">IfNotErrorlevel</a> conditional script branch
commands.<p> This command error value is distinct from the <i>Hipparchus
Library</i> function error return codes referenced above.<p> Here are the
error levels with a few examples: <dl>
<dt>0<dd>OK
<dt>1<dd>warning<br>
        (for example, a derived object is empty)
<dt>2<dd>misdemeanor<br>
        (for example, an object could not be located or
         a region does not pass a topology test)
<dt>4<dd>felony<br>
        (for example, the command syntax was in error).
</dl><p>
(If you are a programmer with access to Galileo source code, be aware that
the manifest constants that map specific errors to these general errorlevels
are specified in <b>galileo.h</b>).<p>

<hr><a name="reference">
<h3>COMMAND REFERENCE</h3></a><p>

This section describes the detailed operation of each of <i>Galileo's</i>
commands.  Examples of most of these commands will be found in the
demonstration scripts supplied. You might find it helpful at this point to
make hard copies of the supplied scripts for ready reference.<p>

<hr><a name="syntax">
<h4>Command Syntax</h4></a><p>

In the following descriptions, P1/p1, P2/p2, ... Pn/pn denote the first,
second, etc. positional parameters that the command accepts or requires.
Upper case indicates required parameters while lower case indicates optional
parameters. Bolded parameter values are keywords.<p>

<hr><a name="common">
<h4>Common Command Parameters</h4></a><p>

A number of command-line parameters are common to multiple commands;
their descriptions follow:<p>

<hr><a name="object-name"></a>
<b>object-name</b><p>

This is a user-defined name, starting with a letter or underscore and
containing only letters, numerals or the underscore ("_").
An object-name refers to a memory-mapped file having the extension <b>.hbo</b>
(for Hipparchus Binary Object).<p>

<b>NOTE:</b>If manipulating Hipparchus binary objects, be sure that the
principal Voronoi index was the one present when the addressed
<b>object-name</b> was entered, imported or derived</b>. If merely displaying
such objects, a search for the appropriate index will be initiated (see <a
href="#objectdisplay">Object Display</a>.<p>

<hr><a name="file-name"></a>
<b>file-name</b><p>

This is a character string, being the name of an external file, qualified by
a path and extension as required. File-names may consist of letters, numerals
or underscores commencing with a letter or underscore ("<b>_</b>") and
containing <b>NO</b> spaces. Otherwise, file-names may be any that are valid
for the operating system.<p>

Special treatment is afforded filenames commencing with these path
qualifiers: <b>data\</b>, <b>scripts\</b>, <b>temp\</b> and <b>georama\</b>.
For any of these qualifiers, Galileo substitutes the corresponding path
defined by the <b>.gin</b> file (and possibly modified by a <b>Set</b>
command).<p>

In the absence of an explicit path specification, <i>Galileo</i> uses one of
the initialization parameters: <b>script.directory</b>, <b>data.directory</b>
or <b>temporary.directory</b> depending on the context of use of the
file-name. These parameters may specify absolute or relative paths.<p>

In the absence of an explicit file-name extension,
<i>Galileo</i> supplies one of the following extensions,
again depending on the context of usage:<p>
<ul>
<li>.gal script files
<li>.hbo Hipparchus Binary Objects
<li>.dmp object dump files (debug)
<li>.pts external point set objects (ASCII lat/lng)
<li>.lns external line set objects (ASCII lat/lng)
<li>.rgn external region objects (ASCII lat/lng)
<li>.ptc external point set objects (ASCII CDC)
<li>.lnc external line set objects (ASCII CDC)
<li>.rgc external region objects (ASCII CDC)
<li>.sat satellite/sensor specifications
<li>.rcv Earth telemetry station specifications
<li>.plr collections of points, lines or regions
<li>.vix Voronoi index files in binary format
<li>.tix Voronoi index files in text format
<li>.cll Voronoi cell lists in text format
<li>.bmp Windows bit map files
<li>.jpg jpeg bit map files
<li>.png png bit map files
<li>.hpg HPGL plotter command stream files
<li>.html HTML documentation (such as this)
</ul>

<hr><a name="collection-name"></a>
<b>collection</b><p>

This is a reference to a file type supported by certain functions of
the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i>. Files of this type are created and
accessed using only the stream I/O facilities of the standard C/C++ run-time
libraries. Such files are designated as "collections" of Hipparchus points,
lines or regions.  They share the same file extension, <b>plr</b>, but have
an internal header that differentiates them.<p>

<hr><a name="resolution"></a>
<b>resolution</b><p>

This refers to the combined coordinate resolution and associated datum
format indicator, as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li>f - float resolution [the default]
<li>h - high resolution
<li>m - medium resolution
<li>l - low resolution<p>
<li>fd - float resolution plus datum
<li>hd - high resolution plus datum
<li>md - medium resolution plus datum
</ul>
<p>

Resolution affects the maximum precision with which an object can be
displayed or related to other objects. The resolution selected also affects
the amount of memory required to model an object. Generally, the higher the
resolution, the more memory required.<p>

If you are having difficulty fitting your application into memory,
you could try reducing the resolution of your larger objects.
If speed is a significant factor, you should specify the float
or float plus datum resolution.<p>

<b>associated data</b><p>

When objects are <b>exported</b> to external storage, any data
(or pointers) associated with its points or vertices are appended
to the coordinate records as ASCII long unsigned integers.<p>

When objects are <b>imported</b> from external storage and associated data
has been specified for the memory object, then an attempt is made to parse
each external point or vertex record for an optional third value (following
its latitude and longitude coordinate values). An integer value found by this
process is associated with the point or vertex as a long (32-bit) signed
integer. When no integer value is found, the null datum (zero) is associated
with the point or vertex. (Note that parsing for this integer will end with
any character encountered that is other than a sign or digit).<p>

When objects are imported from external storage and associated data has
<b>NOT</b> been specified for the memory object, then any external data
items associated with the points or vertices are simply ignored.<p>

When objects are <b>derived</b> from other objects and associated data has
been specified for the derived object, then each point or vertex of the
derived object may have associated with it the datum from one or other of the
parent objects, or the null datum, depending on the operation. For example, a
point set object derived from a <b>DerivePsetInside</b> operation specifying
associated data for its points will have copied into its derived points any
data associated with the parent point set object. On the other hand, a point
set object derived from the <b>DerivePsetIntersectLines</b> operation
specifying associated data will have null data only associated with its
points of intersection.<p>

<hr><a name="latitude"></a><a name="longitude"></a><a name="angle"></a>
<b>latitude</b>, <b>longitude</b><br>
<b>and other sexagesimal angles</b><p>

These are character strings representing angles expressed in the
sexagesimal system.  They may have no embedded spaces.
Either ":" or "/" may be used as a sub-unit separator.
Only the higher-order unit(s) need be specified.
The lowest order unit can include up to 9 decimal fraction digits.
Positive signed angles are normally prefixed by a space while
negative signed angles are prefixed by a "-".<p>

Latitudes may be prefixed by an optional "+", "n", "N" or space
for North values or one of "-", "s" or "S" for South values.
Longitudes may be prefixed by an optional "+", "e", "E" or space for East
values or one of "-", "w" or "W" for West values.
Examples of valid angles are:<p>

<ul><pre>
<li>n43:59:30.0 w7/29/59.999
<li>N43:59.5 W7.500
<li>43 -7.499876543
<li>-6.123 E115:45.2
<li>S88/45.678 +115:44:59.12
</pre></ul>

<hr><a name="scale"></a>
<b>scale</b><p>

Map <b>scale</b> is always specified as a scale <b>denominator</b>.<p>

For example, to specify a map scale of 1:500,000, you specify the integer
500000 or an equivalent decimal or exponential value such as 0.5e6.<p>

Scale controls the size of features and objects displayed on your monitor or
plotter. It is calculated as a function of your monitor's (or plotter's)
physical display area. It is NOT a function of the size of a map window
displayed on that monitor. (The size of a map window controls the
<b>field</b> of the map window, but not the <b>scale</b>).<p>

<b>Note:</b> If you need a precise specification of scale, you will need to
study this note.  The choice of scale denominator depends on a knowledge of
the physical dimensions of the display.  You will need to divide one of the
dimensions of the geographical area you wish to depict by the corresponding
dimension of the display. For example, if the area you want to depict is 100
kilometers across (60 miles) and your display is 0.25 meters (10") wide, you
would divide 100e3 by 0.25 for a scale denominator of 400e3.  However, if the
map display window is planned to be half the width of the display, you would
specify a scale denominator of 2 x 400e3 = 800e6.  If you subsequently change
the size of the map window, you will alter its field but not its scale.

<hr><a name="distance"></a>
<a name="proximity"></a>
<b>distance</b><p>

Wherever distance or proximity is required as a parameter, it is to be
expressed in meters and presented in either integer, decimal or exponential
format. <b>Note</b> that 1km = 1.0e3 meters, approximately 0.6 miles.<p>

<hr><a name="style"></a>
<b>style</b><p>

This is a character string specifying rendering attributes.<p>

It is composed of a set of single-letter codes, each followed by a number
(integer or real), which may be preceded by a hyphen. Letter-number pairs may
optionally be separated by a colon (":") or a slash ("/"). For example, ...,
c13/w2/v1, ...<p>

Style letter codes not specified in a style string are assigned a value of
zero. Most objects or features have a default rendering style specifiable in
the initialization file.<p>

Style letter codes are: <b>crgb  m  wv  n  pq  fjkl</b><p>

These may be combined as appropriate for the object
or feature being rendered:<dl>

Clearly, re-centering the map field by this means is limited to re-centering
to geographic positions that are <i>on-screen</i>.  If you wish to recenter
to some point that is <i>off-screen</i>, you will need first to zoom out
(e.g., <b>ReScale 2.0</b>) a number of times.  Otherwise, you can explicitly
restate the center for the map field using the <b>geometry</b> command.<p>

Re-centering a <b>wwmerc</b> or <b>wwview</b> map field adjusts only the

The second left click sizes the new map field,
changing both the center and scale of the map field.<p>

If the projection of the current map field is <b>wwview</b>, <b>wwmerc</b> or

If P1 is a scale factor, then the scale of the current map field is simply
multiplied by the scale factor. Values less than 1.0 therefore result in a
"zoom in" while values greater than 1.0 result in a "zoom out".<p>

Alternatively, if P1 is one of the letters 'h', 'v' or 'd', then a new scale

of the current map field. (See <a

p1 aspect ratio numerator (an integer)<p>

p2 aspect ratio denominator (an integer).<p>

For map displays in the world-wide Miller-like projection <b>wwview</b>, best
results will be seen with an aspect ratio of 1.242 (p1=1242/p2=1000).<p>

For map displays in the world-wide Mercator projection <b>wwmerc</b>, best

For map displays in all other projections, any reasonable aspect ratio will
do.<p>

If p1 and p2 are omitted, the map window is restored to its original size

<hr><a name="savebitmap">
<b>SaveBitmap</b></a> P1 [p2]<p>

Save map field bitmap to a <b>bmp</b>, <b>jpg</b> or
<b>png</b> formatted graphics file.<p>

P1 Bitmap <a href="#file-name">file-name</a>.<p>

p2 Optional modifier(s) <b>w|t|wt</b>.<p>

If a path is not specified in the file-name, then the configuration parameter
<b>data.directory</b> in the <b>galileo.gin</b> file is supplied.  If a
file-name extension is not specified, then the extension <b>.bmp</b> is
automatically supplied.<p>

Note that the bitmap saved is the map field portion of the Windows "shadow"
of the map window, NOT necessarily the image currently visible in the map
field of the window. (The shadow is used by Windows to restore a window that
has been (partially) obscured by some other window). Galileo commands such
as Draw... and Display... automatically update the shadow. However, other
Galileo commands such as Trace... that leave behind their visual effect do
not automatically update the shadow. If their effect is to be recorded in a
saved bitmap, then they should be followed by the <a
href="#updatebitmap">UpdateBitmap</a> command.<p>

Map field bitmaps saved in the <b>bmp</b> format are processable by the
Windows Paint program and most other graphics image editors.  Be aware that
the <b>bmp</b> file is created using the color depth currently in use by
Windows. Therefore, if you are currently displaying a 16-bit or 24-bit color
pixel, the saved file may be very large, and may require post-process
reduction.<p>

<b>jpg</b> images are processable by most browsers and graphics editors. For
jpg images, be aware that the compression is "lossy" and therefore suitable
ONLY for continuous images such as hypsographic surfaces. Images containing
sharp edges, linework or lettering should never be saved in the jpg
format.<p>

<b>png</b> images are processable by most browsers and graphics editors.
For png images, two additional modifiers are optional.<p>

The <b>w</b> modifier specifies that the color pallette of the saved image be
reduced to the closest colors in the 216 color <a
href="webcolors.html">"websafe" palette</a>.  Png images created using this
option will be significantly smaller in size and thus faster to render.<p>

The <b>t</b> modifier specifies that a png transparency is to be prepared.
The color of the current Galileo background is marked for transparency.<p>

When rendered by an application, pixels having this color are ignored.
In this way the lines, lettering and area fills of a map may be overlaid on
a stylized background (such as birch bark) or a road map can be overlaid on
a hypsographic terrain representation.<p>

The current map field dimensions will normally be the same as that of the map
field from which the bitmap was previously saved (see <a href="#savebitmap">

<hr><a name="objects">
<h3>Object Management</h3></a>

These commands provide for the export, import, direct entry,
display and destruction of the four principal Hipparchus objects:
point sets, line sets, regions and surfaces.<p>

<i>Hipparchus Library</i> functions recognize Hipparchus objects only
in their canonical forms as (virtual) memory-resident structures.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> however extends the definition of these objects to include
several external forms.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> commands in this section may be used to manage the conversion
between the Hipparchus internal canonical forms and one or more of the external
file forms known to <i>Galileo</i>.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> implements Hipparchus canonical internal objects as
Memory-Mapped Files</b>.  As such, these objects have an equivalent external
binary file form, which is persistent.  These external file objects are known
as <b>Hipparchus Binary Objects</b> which are normally identified as files
having the extension <b>.hbo</b>.<p>

Any reference to one of these objects in a <i>Galileo</i> command via
an <a href="#object-name">object-name</a> that does not explicitly specify
the <b>.hbo</b> extension will have this extension added by <i>Galileo</i>.<p>

Also, if the reference lacks a path specification, then <i>Galileo</i>
supplies the configuration parameter <b>data.directory</b> defined in the
<b>galileo.gin</b> initialization file.<p>

External <i>Hipparchus Binary Objects</i> are generally NOT portable across
platforms. Their use should be confined to those platforms on which they were
created.<p>

Both <i>Galileo</i> and <i>Georama</i> provide access to <b>.hbo</b>
memory-mapped external data.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> also implements a variety of ASCII text file formats for the
portable external storage of Hipparchus objects in latitude-longitude
point/vertex coordinate form. These file formats are identical with those
used by previous releases of <i>Galileo</i>, and are therefore both forwards
and backwards compatible with prior releases. In addition, these forms are
generally cross-platform compatible, barring only minor differences in the
treatment of line endings, which are easily overcome. These files are usually
designated by their file-name extensions: <b>.pts</b>, <b>.lns</b> and
<b>.rgn</b>, for point set, line set and region objects, respectively. (No
specific external form for a surface object is implemented in this Release.
However, such an object can be recreated from its source .pts file (cf.
<a href="#derivepsettin">DerivePsetTin</a>). <b>Note</b> that these
coordinates are relative to some specific geodetic datum and ellipsoid. It is
the application architect's responsibility to ensure that inter-system use of
such coordinates is in the context of equivalent geodetic datums and
ellipsoids.<p>

<i>Galileo</i> also offers an alternative method of intersystem coordinate
communication for objects in the form of <b>"concise direction cosines"</b>.
Like latitude-longitude coordinates, these represent an object's global
point/vertex locations, but expressed as 3D vectors normal to the Hipparchus
sphere.  Since the sum of the squares of three (normalized) direction cosines
equals unity, one can be dropped and recomputed as needed. The remaining two
cosines are then expressed as signed 32-bit integers of which the two lowest
order bits are used to encode which of the three cosines was dropped, and its
sign. This scheme provides an isometric resolution of about 1cm on the
Earth's surface. Objects exported/imported in this form are normally
identified by the file extensions: <b>.ptc</b>, <b>.lnc</b> and <b>.rgc</b>,
for point set, line set and region objects, respectively. <b>Note</b> that
just as is the case with conventional latitude/longitudes, concise direction
cosines are relative to some specific geodetic datum and ellipsoid. It is the
application architect's responsibility to ensure that inter-system use of
such coordinates is in the context of equivalent geodetic datums and
ellipsoids.<p>


The <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> include stand-alone, cross-platform console
programs for the batch conversion of external object files between many of
their various forms.<p>

p2 <a href="#file-name">file-name</a><p>

p3 format string for latitudes<p>

p4 format string for longitudes.<p>

This command understands the dimensionality of the object specified
by <b>object-name</b>. If p2 is not specified, then the ASCII output
will be written to a file of the same name as <b>object-name</b>
except that the extension <b>.pts</b>, <b>.lns</b> or <b>.rgn</b>
will be substituted, as appropriate.<p>

ASCII output may consist of lines containing space-delimited latitude,
longitude and associated datum (if present).  Sets of coordinates are aligned
with respect to the columnar placement of their components and decimals (if
any).<p>

If present in the object, the datum associated with each set of coordinates
is output following the longitude as a space-delimited unsigned long integer.<p>

If p2 is a null entry, or is specified explicitly, then the format of the
ASCII sexagesimal latitude and longitudes output to the file-name p2
may optionally be specified by p3 and p4, according to the formatting rules
defined for the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i>
function <b>h0_AngleToString</b>.<p>

Examples follow:<pre>
 n51.123456 w114.123456\n
  s5.123456  e87.654321\n
 n90.000000   w0.000000 0\n
 s90.000000 e180.000000 1\n
  n0.000000 w180.000000 4294967295\n
</pre><p>

The format strings used to produce the example coordinates above are: "nsd6"
and "ewd6".  These are the default formats when the <b>angle.sexagesimal</b>
parameter in the <a href="#gin">galileo.gin</a> file is unspecified or set to
zero.  If <b>angle.sexagesimal</b> is set to one, the default formats for the
export of latitude and longitude coordinates are "nss2" and "ews2",
respectively, giving these angles in degrees, minutes, seconds and hundreths
of seconds, separated by colons, i.e., ddd:mm:ss.ss.<p>

If p2 is explicitly defined as a file having the extension <b>.ptc</b>,
<b>.lnc</b> or <b>.rgc</b>, then the object's point/vertex coordinates will
be output in the form of "concise direction cosines", as pairs of ASCII
integers.  If specified, p3 and p4 are ignored.<p>

All output files are terminated with a line containing an asterisk marker
in column 1.  Non-empty line set and region files will also contain an
asterisk marker line following the last vertex for each line or ring
of the line set or region object.<p>

On export, objects of reduced dimensionality may be derived from <b>.hbo</b>
objects of higher dimensionality.  This is signalled by explicit
specification of an extension in p2. Thus a line set object <b>(.lns)</b> or
a point set object <b>(.pts)</b> may be exported from a region object or a
point set object <b>(.pts)</b> may be exported from a line set object.  A
line set object derived in this way from a region object contains (as lines)
the boundary rings of the region, <i>each closed explicitly by repetition of
the first vertex of the ring.</i>  A point set object derived on export from
a region has (as its points) only the vertices implicitly defining its rings.
A point set object derived on export from a line set object has (as its
points) every vertex defining the line set object. <b>Note</b> that such
objects will be required for computational purposes only.  For example, the
line set object derived in this manner from a region may be imported and used
to determine proximity of a point or point set to the boundaries of that
region.  <b>Note also</b> that such objects are generally <i>NOT</i> required
to render the boundaries or vertices of regions or the vertices of line sets
(see next section).<p>

<hr><a name="objectdisplay">
<h3>Object Display</h3></a>

These commands provide for the display of Hipparchus binary objects (or
parts thereof), or Hipparchus collections.<p>

Hipparchus binary objects and collections are defined in the context of
specific Voronoi indexes. When accessing these entities for display purposes,
Galileo first attempts to match the entity to the principal Voronoi index, as
defined in the control file <a href="#gin">galileo.gin</a> (and
possibly redefined by subsequent <a href="#readvix">ReadVix</a>,
<a href="#readdecryptvix">ReadDecryptVix</a> or <a href="#readtix">ReadTix</a>
commands). Should that match fail, the display commands initiate a search for
previously loaded "secondary" Voronoi indexes. Should that search fail, then
an external search is made of the data subdirectory. If found, that Voronoi
index file is loaded as a "secondary" index. Should no matching index be
found, or should there be an insufficient number of slots or memory to
accommodate it, the user will be advised via an error message.<p>

p2 optional area calculator controls [<b>s</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>r</b>].<p>

If p2 is <b>s</b>, then the calculator assumes that the region has a limited
number of rings and is less than a hundred kilometers or so in extent and so
performs the area calculation with considerably higher precision than in
the general case, i.e., with p2 unspecified.<p>

If p2 is <b>p</b>, then the calculator assumes that adjacent vertices having
approximately the same latitude define a parallel of latitude, rather than a
geodesic. <b>p</b> implies <b>s</b>. Therefore the calculator assumes that
the object is of approximately the same complexity and extent as assumed
above and the computation is performed with similar precision.<p>

If p2 is <b>r</b>, then the calculator expects an object having a number of
rings consisting of exactly four vertices each defining latitude-longitude
"rectangles" on the ellipsoid. The area of this object is calculated with
very high precision, which can be used to gauge the relative precision of the
less stringent computations above. The boundaries of these rings may touch
without invalidating the area computation, so that adjacent "rectangles" are
tolerated. <b>r</b> implies <b>p</b> and <b>s</b>.<p>

Note that perimeter lengths reported are cumulative geodesics and are
unaffected by any of the above options.<p>

<h3>Satellite Orbit and Sensor Swath Modeling</h3></a>

These commands work with satellites: their orbits, sensors and associated
Earth telemetry stations.  Several of the commands can be used to construct
objects on the Earth's surface that can then be related to other objects.<p>

<a name="satellite-name"></a>
<b>Satellite Files</b><p>

Satellite files (<b>*.sat</b>) specify satellite orbit and sensor geometry.<p>

The format of a <b>.sat</b> file is the same as the format of the
<i>georama.gin</i> file. There are two parameter groupings: <ul>
<li><b>orbit.ORBIT_TYPE</b>
<li><b>sensor.SENSOR_TYPE</b>
</ul><p>

The current implementation simplifies things somewhat by restricting
a satellite file to one ORBIT_TYPE (classical) and
one SENSOR_TYPE (allbands).<p>

<a name="orbit-type"></a>
The parameters of the <b>orbit.classical</b> group are:
<ul>
<li>orbit.number = an integer
<li>epoch.date = <a href="#datestring">datestring</a>
<li>epoch.time = <a href="#timestring">timestring</a>
<li>epoch.node = <b>ascending</b>, <b>descending</b> or delay as a
    real number (seconds)
<li>longitude = <a href="#longitude">longitude</a>
<li>inclination = <a href="#angle">angle</a>
<li>argument.perigee = <a href="#angle">angle</a>
<li>semi.major.axis = meters
<li>eccentricity = real number, dimensionless
<li>period = real number, seconds.
</ul><p>

Other orbit types to be implemented are:
<ul>
<li>orbit.nasa...
<li>orbit.norad...
<li>orbit.tbus...
</ul><p>

<a name="sensor-type"></a>
Keywords and data of the <b>sensor.allbands</b> group are:
<ul>
<li>left.limit = <a href="#angle">angle</a>: 0 at nadir, positive left
<li>right.limit = <a href="#angle">angle</a>: 0 at nadir, negative right
</ul><p>

<a name="receivers-name"></a>
<b>Receiver Files</b><p>

Receiver files (<b>*.rcv</b>) specify sets of Earth telemetry stations.<p>

The format of a <b>.rcv</b> file is the same as that of a <b>.pts</b> file except
that multiple data are supplied for each receiver in the set:
<ul>
<li><a href="#latitude">latitude</a>
<li><a href="#longitude">longitude</a>
<li>elevation above sea level (in meters)
<li>width of the cone of reception (<a href="#angle">angle</a> from the zenith)
<li>text naming the station (enclosed in quotes as required).
</ul><p>

<a name="datestring"></a>
<a name="timestring"></a>
<b>Dates and times</b><p>

Commands that require dates and times will accept these elements in
the form parsed by the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> functions
<b>h0_StringToDaynumber</b> and <b>h0_String to Angle</b>
(timestrings being parsed as though angles).
Examples of acceptable dates
and times are:<pre>

<a name="orbitnumber">
<b>orbit number</b><p>
Satellite orbits may be referenced by ordinals that number each orbit from
its defined epoch. When referenced in this manner, a satellite's positions in
that orbit will be calculated from the satellite's classical parameters given
by its <b>.sat</b> file.<p>

<a name="timescale">
<b>time.scale</b><p>

Real-time rendering of the various trace commands is subject to time
compression according to the configuration parameter <b>time.scale</b>
specified in the <b>galileo.gin</b> file.  A real-time delay between
rendering successive orbit positions is calculated by dividing the simulated
time step in orbit by <b>time.scale</b>. For example, if the simulated time
step were 120 seconds and <b>time.scale</b> is 1200, then successive
positions would be planned to be rendered every 1/10th of a second.  If the
time required for the computation for a particular step is less than the
planned delay, then rendering is delayed until the planned delay has expired.
Otherwise, the results of the step calculation are rendered immediately.
<b>Note</b> that the <b>time.scale</b> parameter can be changed at any time
by use of the <a href="#set">Set</a> command.<p>

<h3>Voronoi Index Management</h3></a>

These commands work with Voronoi cell structures.<p>

They are included here to establish specific Voronoi cell structures and to
study their relationship to your application objects.<p>

In earlier releases of <i>Galileo</i>, commands were provided to aid you in
modifying existing Voronoi cell structures for use in your application. Since
Release 3.1, these Voronoi cell structure modification and creation functions
were moved to stand-alone non-graphical utility programs. This change was
made in the interests of performance and cross-platform portability. These
command-line utilities are supplied with Galileo, co-located with
galileo.exe, and may be run independently of Galileo, or through Galileo via
the Galileo <i>Shell</i> command.<p>

Nevertheless, <i>Galileo</i> continues to support the basic Voronoi index
operations required to establish specific Voronoi cell structures as spatial
indexes and to visualize the relationship between those indexes and your
data, in any of the available projections.<p>

A "starter" Voronoi index file is supplied in ASCII center-points form.  This
is isotype.pts (located in the <i>data</i> directory). This Voronoi index
should be regarded as a starter index when densifying or otherwise creating
an application-specific Voronoi index.  If you wish to use isotype directly
as a binary file, you should generate the binary using <i>cellwvs</i> or
<i>cellins</i> stand-alone utilities, like this:<pre>
  cellwvs  isotype.pts isotype.vix
</pre><p>

The isotype index is relatively sparse, having just 272 cells. If your
application requires a more-or-less regular but denser base, you can easily
generate more dense "harmonic" subdivisions as follows: <pre>
  cellwws  isotype.pts  isotype.vix
  cellpts  isotype.vix  isotype2.pts /c /g
  cellwvs  isotype2.pts isotype2.vix
   ...
  cellpts  isotypej.vix isotypek.pts /c /g
  cellwvs  isotypek.pts isotypek.vix
</pre><p>

Here the <i>cellpts</i> utility makes new cell center-points out of the
corner-points of the current structure and adjusts the current
cell center-points to a new "gravity" location, being the vector
mean of the existing corner-points.  The result of this operation
is a new "rounded" structure having approximately three-fold
as many cells.  Since the time required to run <i>cellwvs</i> is very
roughly the square of the number of cells, be prepared to wait
awhile for the higher harmonics!<p>

Before constructing your own Voronoi index, you may wish to view our offering
of freely downloadable prebuilt Voronoi index structures at <a

You may suspend a running script by pressing any letter key.  In this mode,
you may complete and execute a command from the console. Script processing is
resumed on completion of the interposed command. However, if a <b>script</b>
command is interposed, then the running script is ended and a new script (if
any) is started.<p>

Script file lines that are empty or that commence with a semi-colon
('<b>;</b>') are treated as commentary and are ignored by the command
processor.<p>

<a name="label"><b>Labels:</b></a> scripted commands are directly addressable
via script file <b>label</b> entries. These are script file lines commencing
with a colon (':') that introduces a <b>label</b> token.  A label token
consists of one to 32 characters commencing with a letter or underscore
followed by letters, numerals or underscores. Conditional and unconditional
branch commands can transfer control to the first command following a label
entry. A script file can be started at the first command following a specific
label entry in a script.<p>

<a name="delay"><b>Delay:</b></a> several commands provide timed delays
for presentation purposes.<p>

A timed delay can be for a specific amount of time.  Specific time delays are
scripted in terms of an integer number of seconds, but the <b>script.pace</b>
parameter in the <b>galileo.gin</b> file can be set to alter this time scale,
(but never reduce below one half second).<p>

A scripted time delay of zero seconds is considered to be "forever",
inviting a deliberate release using the mouse or keyboard.<p>

Regardless of the delay specified, action can be restarted at any time
by the operator clicking the left mouse button in the console window.<p>

p1 script <a href="#file-name">file-name</a><p>

p2 <a href="#label">label</a> within a script.<p>

A script command given within a script <b><i>chains to</i></b>
rather than <b><i>calls</i></b> the named script file.<p>

If both a script file and a label are specified, then execution of the script
commences at the command following the specified label.<p>

The operating environment of the named script is the current environment.
Any changes made to that environment by the named script
will persist after its completion.<p>

If no parameters are specified, the command has no effect unless it was
interposed from the console into a suspended script, in which case it has the
effect of closing the suspended script (and any calling scripts), returning
control to the console.<p>

A <b>Call</b> command embedded in a script transfers control to the named
script. If a label is specified, then execution of the named script commences
at the command following the specified label.<p>

At <b>end of file</b> in the named script file, or upon encountering a
<a href="#return">Return</a> command, control is returned to the issuing
script immediately following the <b>Call</b> command.<p>

The operating environment of the called script is that of the caller.
Any changes made to that environment by the called script will persist
on return to the calling script.<p>

The <b>Call</b> command is effective only within a script.
Nested <b>Call</b> commands are permitted to a reasonable limit,
beyond which the command is ineffective.<p>

The text message panel is displayed in the map window and the map window
is kept in focus for <b>delay</b> seconds.  The panel is sized to accommodate

P1 String containing a command and its parameters.<p>

Unless specifically qualified, the command is sought first via the system
path, then within the same directory containing <i>galileo.exe</i>. For
this reason, it is convenient to co-locate the Hipparchus Utilities with
<i>galileo.exe</i>.<p>

In the Windows operating system, the command is executed as a separate window
that disappears on completion of the command. Therefore, if you wish to
inspect the <i>stdout</i> or <i>stderr</i> of the command, you will need to
pipe it to <i>more</i> or construct a batch procedure containing a
<i>pause</i>. Such procedures can be built on the fly by use of the <a

<b>Note</b> that the P1 string will normally contain space or comma
delimiters, and should therefore be enclosed in matching single or double
quotation marks.<p>

<h3>STAND-ALONE UTILITIES</h3>

As a convenience in prototyping applications, <i>Galileo</i> includes Windows
executables of all of the stand-alone utilities distributed in source as part
of the <i>Hipparchus Source Materials</i>. As mentioned earlier, Windows
executables are co-located with the galileo.exe program and may be invoked
independently of Galileo or through Galileo via the Galileo <i>Shell</i>
command.<p>

These stand-alone utilities share a simple command-line user interface. Their
command line usage is self-documenting.  For on-line help as to usage, you
simply enter an /h or /? switch after the program name.  For detailed
instructions as to their use, you will need to refer to the <a
href="utilities.html" target="aside">Hipparchus Utilities Guide</a> and/or
the source code.<p>

The following is a list of some of the <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> including
a brief explanation of their purposes:

<h3>ABOUT SCRIPTS</h3></a><p>

By this time, you likely will have reviewed the operation of the various
supplied scripts.  If not, take the time now to browse the contents of the
<b>~\scripts</b> directory, looking for <b>.gal</b> files. You can view
these files with any text editor.<p>

Following the examples given, you should have very little trouble
in developing your own scripts.<p>

Geodyssey is interested in receiving, and possibly publishing,
your most interesting or unusual <i>Galileo</i> scripts.<p>

Here are the submission rules:<p>

Your scripts must be self documented with commentary such that they can be
included "as is" in future releases of the <i>Galileo</i> distribution.<p>

You will have the first ten lines of commentary entirely to yourself as your
credit and copyright notice. The first line must identify your script and its
author's name and date.  Additional comment lines should identify your
organization, address, telephone, fax or e-mail contact numbers. If you wish,
you might also provide your professional qualifications, specialties and
website address.<p>

In addition, you may commence your script with a single opening
<b>ShowPanel</b> message of maximum duration two seconds, which may identify
you and/or your script. In this way, you can have run-time credit.<p>

You may submit your script by mailing a 3.5" disk to Geodyssey Limited at the
address given elsewhere in this Guide.  If your script requires specific data
files not supplied by Geodyssey, you should include these on your disk
submission.  To be eligible for publication, your script and data files must
be limited to 100K bytes of ASCII material, when decompressed.<p>

Submissions will not normally be returned by Geodyssey. From submissions
received, Geodyssey may select your submission for publication in future
releases of this product. Your submission is made by you and received by
Geodyssey with the clear understanding that Geodyssey Limited will have no
liability to you or your organization for future royalties or other
considerations.<p>

If your submission is selected for publication, you will first be contacted
for reconfirmation of your permission to publish.  In order to avoid conflict
between submissions and to ensure that your work will properly function
in future releases, Geodyssey Limited reserves the right to make editorial
changes to your work.<p>

We look forward to receiving your submissions.<p>
