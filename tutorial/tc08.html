<h2>Chapter 8: Utilities and File Operations</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This chapter addresses the need for and availability of stand-alone
utility programs that will assist in the deployment of a Hipparchus-based
application.

<p>Hipparchus stand-alone utilities are cross-platform ANSI C language
programs that must necessarily be compiled and linked for a specific
development or end-user platform. To ensure that this is understood, the
utilities are distributed in source form only.  Being cross-platform, they
invoke no graphical user interface (GUI). Instead, they are restricted to
command line programs that rely at most on the standard C/C++ stream I/O
run-time facilities.

<p>The <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> call on <i>Hipparchus Library</i> and
<i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> functions to perform much of their
required work. Distributed in ANSI C source, portions of their code and
functionality may be incorporated freely into your application.

<h3>Hipparchus Utilities</h3>

<p>The <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> are fully described in the
companion publication <a href="utility.htm">Hipparchus Utilities Guide</a>.

<h3>File Operations</h3>

The <i>h8</i> section of the <i>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</i> contains
functions that enable access to memory-mapped files and a suggested simple
C/C++ stream I/O method of working with static object collections. The use of
these functions is demonstrated in several of the <a
href="../utilities/utilities.html">Hipparchus Utilities</a> as well as <a
href="../galileo/galileo.html">Galileo for Windows 95</a>.

<p><h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> assist the Hipparchus application
programmer to establish an appropriate spatial indexing Voronoi cell
structure, to import or export voluminous data, to create Hipparchus binary
objects as memory-mapped files, to create Hipparchus-oriented static
geographic data collections and to perform miscellaneous off-line file
translations such as the conversion of GPS traces to regular line sets.

<P><hr><a name="ch9"><h2>Chapter 9: Geographics</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to review the various methods of generating
geographic output from your application and receiving geographic (mouse)
input. In addition, we review considerations for the preparation of hard copy
(plotted) output.

<P><h3>The Basics</h3>

<P>First, remember that all of the Hipparchus functions for geographic output
and input have been provided in source form. This is so that you can more
easily interface your application to the graphical environment of your
choice. The majority of the sample graphical functions provided with your
environment are intended for use in Win32 applications. You may choose to use
other GUI options such as Windows CE or X Windows.

<P>The <I>h9</I> section of the <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> provides
you with generic functions to draw geographic points, lines (geodesics)
and objects (point sets, line sets and regions). Other characteristics,
such as color, line width, style, etc., need to be managed by your application.
To expand your graphical capability, please refer to your standard sources
on graphics. Your choice of graphical platform will determine the specific
means to perform the following:
<ul>
<li>paint a pixel (or plot a point)<p>
<li>draw a line on the display (or plotter)<p>
<li>move the cursor (or pen) from one position to another<p>
<li>fill a region with a designated color pattern.<p>
</ul>

<P>In the <I>h9</I> functions, these operations are invoked via macros
(for screen display) that are defined in the header file <I>hippgsys.h</I>.
Their hard copy counterparts are implemented as functions in the
<I>h0_Hpgl...</I> family of functions. If either of these macro/function
groups do not match your environment, you should substitute more appropriate
ones and recompile. For examples of the usage of these basic operations,
please refer to the source for the <I>GALILEO</I> and/or <i>GEORAMA</i>
sample applications.

<P><h3>Display Output</h3>

<P>Output presented on a screen differs from hard copy output formats in one
critical dimension - time! The importance of providing sub-second response
for human interaction is well understood. This means that you must make every
effort to provide rapid delivery of information to the display.

<P>For most textual material, you can deliver a whole screen of information
(say 25 lines of 80 characters each, about 2000 characters) in a relatively
short time. The design and processing considerations to achieve this are
usually straightforward.

<P>For a graphical presentation, however, you may conceivably need to process
10,000 records to extract and draw 10,000 line segments on the display. The
differences are huge, without any consideration of the processing involved.
These differences (i.e., potentially several orders of magnitude in data
volumes) demand a thoughtful approach if you are to achieve the needed speed
and efficiencies.

<P>In particular, you will need to pay special attention to the following:
<ul>
<li>the physical database design<p>

<li>the processing of the data<p>

<li>the hardware and operating system capabilities (cpu, graphics adapter
and disk performance).<p>
</ul>

<P>Hipparchus has been designed to help optimize the performance of your
geographic presentations.

<P>First, Hipparchus can provide extremely efficient indexing to your
externally stored data. This means that when your user opens a window on a
particular view of her/his data, Hipparchus can help you find that data
faster than ever before, all other things being equal.

<P>Second, in directing your search for the data, Hipparchus can select only
that output information which is required for the window. In other words,
Hipparchus is smart enough to tell you what to ask for from your database
(i.e., only that data for the presentation window that fits inside the
window, or along its border). There is not much use in retrieving more data
for presentation than is absolutely necessary. But, having retrieved the
interior and border data, you will normally use your graphics package (GUI)
to "clip" any points, lines or areas that might be just outside the window
frame.

<P>Third, Hipparchus provides very efficient projection algorithms in mapping
geographic features from the ellipsoid to the plane of the display. More is
said later about your various projection options. Our point here is that
these algorithms are very fast and take special advantage of the internal
storage formats used extensively in Hipparchus to represent geographic
objects.

<P>These three features of Hipparchus combine to provide a very powerful
engine for generating geographic presentations. This will become even more
apparent to your users when they change the scale or move the viewpoint of a
window. Redraw times will be the fastest that they have likely ever seen.

<p>With other systems, the designers have usually had to trade off
inefficient data retrieval and projection calculations for acceptable
application response times. To effect this trade-off, window scales and
viewpoints are often restricted to pre-set options so that a whole area of
interest can be retrieved and projected on the first request. Subsequent
requests merely move the window around in this larger area, without
re-projecting. Although such secondary browsing techniques may have
acceptable response times, they generally have undesirable effects on RAM
usage and presentation resolution. Usually, just one Earth tangency point has
been chosen for the projection, so as the user moves away from this point,
the inherent planar distortion of the display increases.

<P>With Hipparchus, however, you will be able to let your client roam freely,
without prior restriction as to projection, scale or viewpoint. Since data
can be selectively retrieved at high speed every time your client respecifies
the window, you will seldom need to provide intermediate buffering. And since
its geographic attributes can be efficiently re-projected with every change
of the window, the presentation will always be at the maximum accuracy
obtainable from your client's database and display equipment. The Earth
tangency point for the display will always be centered in the window and the
pixel scaling factor chosen so that the maximum resolution is obtained for
that window.

<P><h3>Mouse Input</h3>

<P>As well as speeding the output of geographic information, Hipparchus
can also be used as a powerful ally in its input.

<P>If your application environment will include a graphics pointing device
(for example, a mouse), then you will be able to use the "un-mapping"
functions of the <I>Hipparchus Library</I>. These functions let you relate
pixel coordinates read from your mouse driver (or GUI) to positions and
objects on the ellipsoidal Earth.

<P>For example, you might ask your user to "point and click" at a particular
spot on the ground for which she/he needs more information. By un-mapping
the window coordinates to ground coordinates, you can select a new window
scale and tangency point, and then re-select and re-project the information
for the next window display. For an example of this type of operation, see
<i>GALILEO</i>'s <i>Reframe</i> command.

<P>In another example, you might ask your user to use the mouse to trace out
the boundary of an area of interest. You would then unmap the whole sequence
of window coordinates making up the area, construct an internal region
object, intersect this with other data objects and give her/him back the
resulting selection of data. For examples of these operations, see again the
sample application <i>GALILEO</i> and its <i>Interact.scr</i> script.

<P>You will find many examples of mouse input possibilities in the sample
programs. For more information, see <I>Appendix B - Galileo and Georama</I>.

<P><h3>Cartographic Projection Options</h3>

<P>In constructing your various geographic displays, you might want to
view the surface of the Earth in three quite different ways:
<ul>
<li>as a view of the relevant patch, region or continent (for example,
downtown Cincinatti, Cook County, New York State, or Africa)<p>
<li>as a picture of the entire Earth (flattened onto the display, of
course), or<p>
<li>as a 3D (three dimensional) view of the globe, as if from space.<p>
</ul>

<P>Hipparchus allows you to choose any one of these three views using the
following cartographic projections:
<ul>
<li>gnomonic
<li>stereographic
<li>local Mercator
<li>conical (Lambert-like)
<li>world-wide Mercator
<li>world-wide Miller-like
<li>orthographic.
</ul>

<P>First, the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> provides functions to map positions
from the ellipsoid to positions on the plane using any of these seven
projections. For each mapping function provided, there is a corresponding
un-map function that projects from the plane back onto the ellipsoid.

<P>To support general geographic display needs, we have provided higher
level <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> functions to enable the rapid
development of geographic displays. These are available in source form
so that you can see how it's done.

<P>You may require some guidance in selecting an appropriate projection
and scale for your displays.

<P>The <B>stereographic</B> projection (<b>stereo</b>) is usually used to
display maps that depict areas of the Earth not greater than a continent.
Despite its name, it does <B>not</B> convey a sense of the third dimension.
Here is an example of a <a href="tf18.gif">stereographic projection</a>.

<P>It's most striking features are the following:
<ul>
<li>areas which are equal on the Earth are approximately equal on a
    display<p>
<li>dimensions are relatively isometric over large areas<p>
<li>meridians and parallels are somewhat curved in a display.<p>
</ul>

<P>The stereographic projection is an excellent one for depiction of smaller
areas anywhere on the surface of the Earth. The tangency point can be
anywhere, even centered on one of the poles. The stereographic projection is
developed as though the Earth were hollow and rays of light defining the
features were emanating from a point on the other side of the Earth from the
tangency point, that is to say, from the point antipodal to the tangency
point.

<P>The <B>gnomonic</B> projection (<b>gnomonic</b>) is often used for the
depiction of small objects. Like the stereographic projection, its tangency
point can be anywhere. The gnomonic projection is developed as though the
Earth were hollow and rays of light defining the features were emanating from
the <I>center</I> of the Earth.

<P>For small areas, the gnomonic projection has attributes very similar to
the stereographic projection. Since it is far faster to generate, it is the
projection of choice for the depiction of small objects at large scale.

<p>The <b>Lambert-like</b> projection (<b>conical</b> is a display option
used to approximate the Lambert-1 or Lambert-2 projections used mainly in
the aeronautical and meteorological fields.

<P>The <B>world-wide Mercator</B> projection (<b>wwmerc</b>) is the familiar
projection in which all of the world can be depicted on one display. Figure
17 is an example of a Mercator projection.

<P>Of course, the Mercator projection suffers badly from distortion near the
poles. However, it has compensating advantages. These are: <ul> <li>the
identifiable nature of shapes is preserved <li>dimensions are relatively
isometric for local areas<li>meridians and parallels form right angle
intersections. </ul>

<P>Mercator projections usually depict the whole world centered at the prime
meridian (which passes through London). With the <I>Hipparchus Library</I>,
you can center the projection on any meridian and depict smaller areas than
the entire Earth. By definition, the Mercator projection always has a
tangency point on the Equator. The Mercator projection appears somewhat as
though it might be developed by projecting rays from the center of a hollow
Earth onto a cylindrical screen wrapped around it, touching at the Equator.
The Mercator projection however is not actually a projection in the geometric
sense; it is defined in a mathematical sense only.

<p>The world-wide Miller-like projection (<b>wwview</b>) also depicts the
whole world centered at a meridian of your choice. Unlike the world-wide
Mercator projection, the world-wide Miller-like projection caries the view to
the poles. This projection is particularly useful in depicting the paths of
polar orbiting satellites.

<P>The <B>orthographic</B> projection (<b>ortho</b>) is sometimes called a
"3D" projection in that it depicts the Earth as seen from space. This
projection is developed as though the observer was infinitely far away, but
its scale can be set freely so that it occupies more or less of the display.
You can also set the tangency point freely, so that your user can look at the
Earth from directly above any point, even one of the poles. Figure 16 is an
example of an orthographic projection.

<P>To support your geographic display development, we have included a number
of generic geographic display functions that can complement your own graphics
support facilities.

<P>The <I>h9</I> section of the <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> provides
projection functions for the following geographic features:
<ul>
<li>points and point sets
<li>lines and line sets
<li>region boundaries
<li>region area fills.
</ul>

<P>The <I>h9</I> section of the <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> also
provides a useful set of map generation functions which include:
<ul>

<li>a stereographic line (geodesic)

<li>a stereographic latitude/longitude grid

<li>a gnomonic line (geodesic)

<li>a gnomonic latitude/longitude grid

<li>a Lambert-like line (geodesic)

<li>a Lambert-like latitude/longitude grid

<li>a Mercator line (geodesic)

<li>a Mercator latitude/longitude grid

<li>a Miller-like line (geodesic)

<li>a Miller-like latitude/longitude grid

<li>an orthographic line (geodesic)

<li>an orthographic latitude/longitude grid, (with longitudes suppressible
    for displays in which animated views of Earth will be rotated).
</ul>

<P>With this set of functions, you can display virtually any combination of
points, lines and regions in a variety of formats. The stereographic,
gnomonic, Lambert-like, Mercator, Miller-like and orthographic projection
options permit you to generate geographic displays in forms familiar to your
clients.

<P>The <I>h0</I> section provides functions for generating specific coastline
displays using any of the seven projections: stereographic, gnomonic,
conical, Mercator, word-wide Mercator, worldwide Miller-like or orthographic.
These functions use world coastlines data packaged exclusively for this
purpose. Using these coastlines for visual orientation can make the display
of your other data more effective. For more about the world coastlines data,
see <I>Appendix B - Galileo and Georama</I>.

<P><h3>Scaling of Output</h3>

<P>To present your output, either on a display or in hard copy, you need
to select an appropriate scale. Scale is defined as the ratio of a window
distance to an equivalent distance on the ground. For your display, you
need to know its size and decide what portion of it you want to use for
a window and for the object to be displayed. You may want to reserve a
portion of the display or window for error messages or other textual data.

<P>Typically, a color display screen will be 10 inches wide and 7.5 inches
high (having an aspect ratio of 4:3). In metric or SI units, this will
be 0.254 meters by 0.184 meters (25cm x 18cm). These are typical numbers.
Refer to the technical reference manual for your specific display monitor
for the exact numbers for your display, or better yet, measure them yourself!

<P>In mapping, scale is represented as a ratio, for example 1:50,000. In this
example, every 1 millimeter (mm) on the map represents 50,000 millimeters (50
meters) on the ground. The ratio a:b gets a bit trickier when different units
are used. For example, where one inch on the map is used to represent one
mile on the ground, the scale will be 1:63,360 (figure it out). In general,
there's less chance of error when you calculate scale using metric units.

<P>If you wanted to display an image of the entire Earth on your display,
you would need to know the size of the Earth as well as the size of the
display area. The Earth's radius is about 6,370,000 meters. Double that
for its diameter. To see it displayed with some room to spare around it,
you might decide to scale it such that it would be 15 cm in diameter on
the display. To set the scale, you would merely divide the Earth's real-life
diameter (6,370,000 meters times 2) by the display diameter (0.15 meters)
to get the scale (1:84,900,000). You would normally present the inverse
of this scale to the Hipparchus functions as an exponential number, in
this case 84.9e6.

<P>You normally use the function <I>h9_InitWindow</I> to set the scale of the
window for subsequent presentation of objects.

<P><h3>Topographical Data</h3>

<P>You should always consider importing topographical data for use in
providing visual references for your graphic presentations. For example, you
may have access to a file of data on roads, rivers, railways, survey lines,
etc. It is a simple matter to create an object from this data and display it
as needed by your application. Even if such objects are never brought
directly into your computations, they can often help the end users to orient
themselves to a particular presentation.

<P>See <I>Appendix C - Bibliography</I> for some leads on sources of digital
information.

<P><h3>Hard Copy Output</h3>

<P>For hard copy plotted results, <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I>
functions can be used to generate <I>HP-GL/2</I> (<I>Hewlett-Packard Graphics
Language</I>) printer/plotter protocol. These routines have been provided in
source form so you can adapt them to any other protocol you wish. Hipparchus
does not particularly care what you use. Only the normal caveat applies: any
"replacing" function must be syntactically the same (i.e., use the same
arguments and return the same values).

<P>The sample programs include copious examples of methods and techniques
for generating plotted hard copy of your geographics. For additional
information about the sample programs, refer to <I>Appendix B - Galileo
and Georama</I>.

<P>When you are producing hard copy plotted results, remember that people
will often use this output as an overlay for other graphic material. Also,
remember that some clients may attempt to use a ruler and compass to perform
other calculations using the hard copy output. For these situations, you
must be particularly careful about the projection, scale and viewpoint,
and your clients will need to have some understanding of mapping in general.
For further information, refer to the text by Davis et al described in
<I>Appendix C - Bibliography</I>.

<P><h3>Geographics Examples</h3>

<P>To further explore the possibilities for the graphic presentation of
geographic information, we refer you to <I>Appendix B - Galileo and
Georama</I>.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>Providing graphic application input and output is a challenging element of
computing. Hipparchus allows you easily to interface to a GUI of your choice
for interactive graphic input and output. The connection is simple and direct
as discussed in <I>Chapter 2 - Computing Environments</I>. Once this is done,
there are few considerations beyond the obvious when you are rendering output
from your application. Some day, when we eventually have access to
inexpensive holographic 3D display systems, using the Hipparchus capabilities
will become even more exciting.
