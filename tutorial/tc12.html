<h2>Chapter 12: Advanced Topics</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to introduce just a few advanced subjects
relating to the use of the <I>Hipparchus Library</I>. You may want to defer
concentrated study of this chapter until you have completed one or more pilot
implementations of your application. At a minimum however you should skim the
material to see what's covered.

<P><h3>External Data Storage Strategies</h3>

<P>Hipparchus makes no specific demands on what type of DBMS you must use.
You can use a relational, network, hierarchical or object-oriented database
management system, or no DBMS at all. The choice of DBMS is strictly yours.

<P>If your data is not too voluminous or the speed of its retrieval is not an
issue, then you might opt to maintain maximum flexibility by using a
relational database manager. By contrast, if your application uses a lot of
static location data or has stringent interactive processing requirements,
then you might consider the use of a network or hierarchical database
manager.

<P>However, for many applications, you may choose to use no DBMS at all,
relying entirely on the C/C++ stream I/O run-time facilities of your
operating system. The sample programs abound with examples of this approach.

<P>You may choose to store location information in external storage using
formats different from those needed for direct memory manipulation by the
Hipparchus engine. Again, the choice of external storage format is yours.

<P>If your externally-stored location information is used frequently in other
systems or is often updated externally, then you will probably choose a
global coordinate format. This could take the form of sexagesimal latitudes
and longitudes in data type <I>char</I> string format, radian latitudes and
longitudes in data type <I>double</I> format, or direction cosines in data
type <I>double</I> format.

<P>If maximum resolution is not an issue, then you might opt to truncate
any of these forms. For example, you might record sexagesimal angles to
the nearest tenth of a degree. Or you might record radian angles using
<I>float</I> rather than <i>double</i> format. Or you might record direction
cosines using any one of the <I>float</I>, <I>long int</I> or <I>short
int</I> formats (direction cosines being normalized).

<P>On the other hand, if your data is used mainly by the one application, or
is relatively static, you will likely choose an external format that
retains the Hipparchus cell local coordinate form, the cell differential
coordinates. You might use any one of the formats available depending on the
precision requirements of the application. In any of these formats, your data
may be retrieved faster and your memory objects constructed much faster too.
But if you later densified or re-specified the associated Voronoi cell
structure, you would have to go through some or all of the external data and
update the cell local coordinates. If you store your external data in cell
local coordinate form, then you must arrange to store its associated Voronoi
cell structure definition along with it, somewhere.

<P>Your application can add additional intelligence about your data in order
to reduce its storage requirements. For example, let us assume you have two
parcels of land (objects A and B) that have a common boundary. You could
economize on the amount of data being stored if your application recognized
the common boundary. In readying object A for analysis by Hipparchus, the
common boundary line could be retrieved as part of a region definition. Then
to ready object B, you could retrieve the same data (in reverse order) as
part of the region definition for object B. (Note that the legal descriptions
of such parcels of land often stand on their own and may need to be modeled
independently.)

<P><h3>External Object Management</h3>

<P>As described elsewhere, the objects of interest to Hipparchus are spatial
objects. They represent things, conditions or events on or near the surface
of the Earth. Using Hipparchus, the spatial relationships among objects can
be determined and new objects derived.

<P>Hipparchus performs all of its primary functions in the (virtual) main
memory of the computer (RAM) using the data structures and canonical forms
described in the <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I> and detailed by
the accompanying C/C++ language header files.

<P>You are therefore free to orchestrate the construction, indexing and
disposition of these well-defined memory-based objects using whatever
strategy best serves the application.

<P>Any spatial object must necessarily consist of the elemental point or
vertex locations that define the points, lines or rings that make up the
object set. We have already mentioned that you can represent these locations
using cell local or global coordinates in a number of different formats. We
need to discuss now the various ways you might manage the collections of
point or vertex locations that define the application objects.

<P>For prototypes and simple applications, you can keep it simple and use the
ASCII object management facilities of the <i>Galileo</i> program
described in <I>Chapter 10 - Sample Applications</I>. These facilities can
store and retrieve objects as named ASCII flat files.

<P>For more data intensive applications, you will probably want to
investigate the alternatives for organizing and managing your point or vertex
location data.

<P>First, you need to decide how to link the location information with all of
the other attributes referenced by the application. When the objects are
merely single-point sets, this is no more complicated than adding the
location attribute to the table or record layout that specifies the other
attributes.

<P>If your data has just one attribute (such as elevation) related to each
point or vertex of a set, then you can associate that data directly with the
Hipparchus cell local coordinates in the memory model. In such cases, you
will likely want to keep the extra attribute closely associated with the
coordinates in external storage too.

<P>In the more general case where your objects are multi-point sets, lines or
regions, having other attributes that relate to the set as a whole, a
separate table can hold the non-location attributes and a simple
cross-reference can be made to the object location definition tables. You
will likely use separate tables to define point set objects, line set
objects and region (ring set) objects.

<P>Most developers will want to make maximum use of Hipparchus' superior
spatial indexing. As described elsewhere, Hipparchus' spatial indexing power
is derived from properties of the Voronoi cell structure.

<P>In the first instance, the cell structure is used internally to determine
which cell contains a point or a line or ring vertex, given its global
coordinates. Perhaps more importantly, it can be used to access efficiently
any data from external storage.

<P>In the simplest scheme, you can sort and store your external point or
vertex data by its containing cell identifiers. Then when you want to access
data related to that point or vertex you can look up that cell's physical
storage location (using your DBMS index) and go directly to the cluster of
all your data relating to that cell.

<P>More elaborate schemes can permit objects or partial objects to be dealt
with in memory on a restricted geographic basis, with reference being made to
external storage only when the area of interest shifts. Hipparchus provides
the means to discover what Voronoi cells are occupied, traversed or contained
by an object, and vice versa. This means that you can find all the cells for
a given object or all the objects for a given cell, or both. You can also
find all the cells containing data for a specific graphics window. This very
powerful capability gives you considerable latitude in organizing your data
efficiently.

<P><h3>Working With Cellstrings</h3>

<P>You know that Hipparchus keeps track internally of the close relationship
between a cell structure and the objects that you have created in memory.

<P>For every object, Hipparchus knows what cells contain the points or
vertices that describe the geographic position of that object. For line
sets and regions, Hipparchus also knows if cells were "overflown" by line
or ring segments. For regions, Hipparchus also knows what cells are entirely
contained within the object.

<P>Conversely, for any cell, Hipparchus can easily determine what objects
are inside it, have segments in it, overfly it, or completely contain it.

<P>Hipparchus organizes and works with this information using "cellstrings".
A cellstring is simply a memory list of cell identifiers. Hipparchus creates
cellstrings in memory that are usually allocated from your system heap. It
creates, uses and destroys them in memory in the normal course of creating,
manipulating and destroying your geographic objects. In addition, Hipparchus
maintains cellstrings in conjunction with any graphic windows that you might
define.

<P>If you intend to develop some of the advanced concepts of database
organization or graphics rendering, you will want to study these functions
and structures in some detail. The functions that work with cellstrings are
described in sections <I>h1</I>, <I>h6</I>, <I>h7</I> and <I>h9</I> of the
<I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I>. Cellstring structures are defined
by the header file <I>hipparch.h</I>.

<P><h3>Cell Numbering</h3>

<P>The order in which cells are numbered can affect the performance of some
applications. These would be applications having specific user patterns of
interaction or applications in which objects frequently span multiple cells.
In such cases, you may want to "bias" the cell numbering to favor one
direction over another. For example, if you are modeling geological
formations in Western Canada, you might bias the cell numbering for that part
of the world in a Northwest to Southeast direction, parallel to the natural
geology of the region. In another example, if you were modeling
trans-Atlantic air traffic routings, you would probably want to bias the
order of cells to favor an East-West direction. You are not obliged to apply
any one bias to all parts of your coverage.

<P>You can control the cell numbering sequence by the order in which you
present explicit cell center points to the cell structure construction
process. For example, if you are creating a cell structure using the
<I>CELLWVS</I> or <i>CELLINS</i> utilities, then the cells of the resulting
structure are numbered according to their order of appearance, starting with
zero. You can therefore control cell numbering by controlling the order of
presentation to the structuring process. Another utility, <i>CELLORD</i>
provides the means to renumber cells according to their geographic proximity
to a specific point on the Earth's surface.

<P>If you have not changed the location of any of these cell center points,
then you can be confident that the new structure will work properly, and
likely faster.

<P><h3>Size of Your Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>Since the Voronoi cell structure forms the basis for spatial indexing, its
specific configuration for your application affects the overall performance
of the application, both internally and externally.

<P>Generally speaking, the more finely divided the structure, the faster
the application will perform. Even though a finely divided structure implies
longer process times to navigate, these costs will usually be offset by
significant efficiencies in external indexing and internally in calculating
the spatial relationships among objects.

<P>As you learned in <I>Chapter 7 - Refining Your Design</I>, you will
need to provide enough processor memory (RAM) to accommodate the one or
more structures that your application references. This may well be the
principal limitation to size for your Voronoi cell structures. There may
be other version or release dependent limitations as well. For the details
of these, consult the accompanying <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK <I>README</I> file.

<P><h3>Localized Applications</h3>

<P>If specific instances of your application will be restricted to small
areas such as a municipality, then you will want to develop a Voronoi cell
structure that is finely-divided in the locality of interest and coarsely
divided elsewhere.

<P>In <I>Chapter 8 - Utilities</I>, we described the cell construction and
modification utilities how you can use them to derive application-specific
Voronoi cell structures. Here we will discuss the merits of each approach for
highly localized applications.

<P>If your data is more or less evenly distributed (spatially) throughout
the local area of interest, then generation of a Voronoi cell structure
using the <i>Cluster</i> utility is probably the best solution. Not
only is it the easiest method, it has the advantage of controlling the
maximum cell radius and therefore the worst-case loss of resolution for
objects represented using cell local coordinates. (This is discussed in
greater detail in the section <B>Resolution Options</B>, following).

<P>If, however, your data is irregularly distributed (spatially) throughout
the local area of interest, and if external data storage and retrieval issues
are central to your application, then you will probably need to use the
<I>DENSIFY</I> utility to generate the most efficient Voronoi cell
structure. Especially if the data is static, it may well be worth the extra
work involved in assembling the representative data required for the
<I>DENSIFY</I> utility.

<P>Of course, you can also follow both procedures, combining the advantages
of both. You might use <I>CLUSTER</I> to provide assurance of resolution and
follow with the use of <I>DENSIFY</I> to further sub-divide for indexing
efficiency.

<P>It should be noted that a localized application can deal with more than
one local area. For example, an application might provide great detail
concerning two municipalities located thousands of miles apart. In a virtual
memory computing environment, the very large Voronoi structure required might
easily be accommodated.

<P><h3>Custom-Building A Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>As mentioned in <I>Chapter 6 - Working With Cells</I>, we recommend
that you avoid custom-building your own Voronoi cell structure until you
have become quite familiar with the relationships between your cells, your
geographic objects and the various Hipparchus functions available.

<P>If that time has now arrived, then you will need to consider a number
of design factors described below:
<ol>

<li>In general, you should never try to force your data points to fall into
specific cells. Put differently, never try to position cell boundaries in any
particular way. Not only is this very difficult to achieve, it serves no
useful purpose. The cell boundaries are imaginary in nature, having a
geometry that is dependent on the center points of each cell and its
neighbors. You choose your cell center points and these imply your cell
boundaries. The reverse is impractical.<p>

<li>You should not attempt to use the locations of specific application
data objects as cell center points. For example, you would <B>not</B> use
the <I>cities.pts</I> locations as center points for an alternate Voronoi
cell structure for the tutorial program <I>CITIES</I>. Although this will
not upset any calculations, it confuses the role of the center point. Your
successor may misinterpret its meaning. Besides, you will want to keep
open the option of using <B>any</B> location as a cell center point. This
might become important, should you ever need to adjust your cell structure.
For example, you might want to increase the density in a particular region
to reflect local growth. So keep your list of cell center points as an
entirely separate file, used only for the purpose of building your cell
structure.<p>

<li>You must resist any temptation to line up your cell center points
in a geographically regular pattern. For Voronoi cell structures, regularity
is exactly what you want to avoid. Hipparchus works best if the points
you use for your cell center points are more or less irregularly
distributed.<p>

If a contrary attempt is made to use either the <I>CELLWVS</I> or
<i>CELLINS</i> utilities to build a structure from cell center points laid
out in a regular pattern, either will likely fail. In the process of
building the structure, these programs call on the <I>Hipparchus Library</I>
functions <I>h6_CellSortWave</I> or <I>h6_CellSortInsert</I>, respectively.
If the points are too regular, then either one of these functions will fail,
returning an error message that lists four points which caused the problem.
If you are really determined to use such a pattern, you could write your own
program using these functions and you could recover from such problems
automatically by slightly adjusting the location of one or more of the
problem center points.<p>

Note that despite their names, these functions <B><I>DO NOT</I></B> sort the
cell structure into any particular order. They are so named because they
"sort out" which cells are neighbors. For a discussion on controlling the
numeric order of cells in a structure, see the section <B>Cell Numbering</B>
in this chapter.<p>

<li>Even if your general layout is irregular, you should be careful to
not set adjacent cell centers on the same parallel or meridian. If adjacent
cell center points are exactly aligned North and South, or East and West, the
alignment itself can cause difficulties.<p>

<li>If for convenience you want to use the well-documented locations of real
objects (other than application-related objects), you could use the locations
of selected lighthouses, air navigation radio stations, mountain peaks or
geodetic survey control points. It doesn't really matter what you use, just
so long as the cell center points are not laid out according to a regular
geometric pattern.<p>

</ol>

<P>If you follow these guidelines, you should have few problems in
custom-building your own Voronoi cell structure.

<P><h3>Resolution Options</h3>

<P>When you are defining the various classes of objects that your application
will work with, you will need to specify the levels of resolution for each of
your objects. As you study the next few paragraphs, you might wish to refer
to Figures 26 and 27 following.

<P><img SRC="tf26.gif" HEIGHT=595 WIDTH=398 ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<P><img SRC="tf27.gif" HEIGHT=595 WIDTH=398 ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<P>Within Hipparchus, cell local coordinates are usually used to define the
locations of the points or vertices that describe the spatial attributes of
an object. Although global coordinates can be used for external definition of
any object, only cell local coordinates are used to define objects that are
going to be treated by Hipparchus as sets.

<P>This was decided for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the
economy of RAM usage. Most objects defined by cell local coordinates will
occupy less memory because of their differential coordinate encoding.

<P>But also, when an object is associated with a Voronoi cell structure, the
calculation of its spatial relationship with other objects can provably be
reduced to be a function of their spatial relationships within individual
Voronoi cells. Because of this fact, complex geometric calculations often can
be avoided. For example, if two objects have no <I>occupied cells, traversed
cells, boundary or interior</I> cells in common, you can properly deduce,
without geometric calculations of any kind, (or a degree in rocket science),
that these objects have no ground in common, period.

<P>The above factors contributed to the Geodyssey design decision to use
cell-associated local coordinates for the default representation of
terrestrial objects in memory.

<P>Cell local coordinates define the position of a point or vertex in terms
of the global coordinates of the containing cell center point and two
additional projection coordinates. These additional coordinates record the
position of the point or vertex relative to the cell center point in a planar
gnomonic projection of the cell. Because the cell center point position is
already known, its coordinates need not be repeated when defining the
location of specific points or vertices. Only the cell identifier need be
known or recorded in association with a particular point or vertex.

<P>The two projection coordinates are referred to as the "cell dx" and
"cell dy" coordinates. Following common surveying practice, they are also
sometimes called "Eastings" and "Northings". For cells of even the largest
practical size, the fundamental units of resolution of these coordinates
are approximately equal whether near or far from the local cell center
point.

<P>For any specific object, these two projection coordinates can be given
in any one of four formats, named for the class of resolution they provide.

<P>The numeric resolutions obtainable using any of these options are platform
dependent, since they depend on the specific implementation of the C/C++
language data types <I>signed char</I>, <I>short int</I>, <I>float</I>, and
<I>long int</I>. The following discussion assumes the most common
microprocessor implementation in which the <I>signed char</I> type has 7
significant bits, the <I>short int</I> type has 15, the<I> long int</I> type
has 31, and the <I>float</I> type has 23.

<P><B>Low resolution</B> format divides your longest cell center-to-vertex
distance (cell maximum radius) into 127 equal parts. Under this format, the
projection coordinates are represented using the data type <I>signed
char</I>. For a cell having a maximum radius of 5 miles the resolution using
this format would be approximately 207 feet (5 times 5280 feet divided by
127). This resolution could be entirely appropriate for handling references
to weather conditions or for working with objects that are used only for
visual reference purposes in displays of large areas.

<P><B>Medium resolution</B> format provides a division of your longest cell
center-to-vertex distance (cell maximum radius) into 32,512 equal steps. The
projection coordinates are represented using the data type <I>short int</I>.
For a cell with a maximum radius of 5 miles, this option would provide a
resolution of about 10 inches on the ground (5 times 5280 feet times 12
inches divided by 32,512). This option will often be adequate for the
representation of objects located using GPS receivers or objects used mainly
for display purposes.

<P><B>High resolution</B> format provides a division of your longest cell
center-to-vertex distance (cell maximum radius) into 2,130,707,432 equal
steps. The projection coordinates are represented using the data type <I>long
int</I>. For a cell with a maximum radius of 1000 miles, this option would
still provide an apparent resolution of better than 3/100th of an inch on the
ground (1000 times 5280 feet times 12 inches divided by 2,130,706,432).
Therefore, since cells of maximum radius 1000 miles are probably the largest
you would ever use in an application, you will likely never sacrifice any
resolution by using the <B>high resolution</B> local coordinate format.

<P><B>Note: </B>For the three integer types described above, the divisors
127, 32,515, and 2,130,706,432 differ by powers of two only. This is done
so that in binary computing environments you may optionally downgrade the
resolution of an object by simple truncation of the projection coordinates.
(In hexadecimal notation, these values are 0x7F, 0x7F00, and 0x7F000000,
respectively).

<P><B>Float resolution</B> format provides moderately high resolution mid-way
between <B>medium resolution</B> and <B>high resolution</B>. This format uses
the data type <I>float</I> to record the local projection coordinates of each
point or vertex location for the object. Using this level of resolution you
can maintain millimetric minimum resolution for cells of up to about 8.4 Km
maximum radius. Owing to the nature of the floating point representation of
numbers, this minimum (worst-case) resolution will be doubled every time the
cell maximum radius is doubled. In perhaps more familiar terms, if a cell
maximum radius is 16 miles, the worst-case resolution will be one eighth of
an inch. A cell could have a maximum radius of 125 miles and the worst case
resolution would still be better than an inch. Since the <I>float</I> data
type usually occupies as much RAM as the <I>long int</I> type, you might ask,
"Why not always use the <B>high resolution</B> option instead of the <B>float
resolution</B>"? The answer is that in most computing environments, use of
the <I>float</I> type will be faster.

<P>Figure 20 illustrates graphically why the worst-case numeric resolution
is a function of maximum cell radius and resolution format.

<P>For a particular platform, Figure 27 plots the minimum (worst case)
resolution against maximum cell radius for the four resolution options
available.

<P>You need not commit forever to a particular format. The means are
available to convert objects from one format to another. However, if you are
concerned about a possible loss of precision in your results due to your
choice of the resolution format option for a particular object, then by all
means use the <B>high resolution</B> format.

<P><h3>Advanced Logic</h3>

<P>In <I>Chapter 5 - Design Concepts</I> we left a number of your anticipated
user questions unanswered. In this section, we will address how you might
resolve such questions using Hipparchus functions and some creative
manipulation of your geographic objects.

<P>In anticipation of your client asking additional questions, you assembled
some additional data. Now that you have learned more about your various
processing options, let's look at how you might apply them.

<P>Recall that one of the anticipated questions involved finding cities
that are nearby <B>salt water</B>.

<P>Without going into the actual programming, here is one method of
qualifying the search, using the water salinity data you have assembled:
<ul>
<li>select salinity readings that are above your client's definition of
"salty" and construct a queue of "salty" points.<p>
<li>make separate regions out of each line of the line set. Your coastlines
line set object is known to be derived from a region defining dry land.
You therefore know the sense of the lines (dry land on the left). You decompose
the line set, reversing line segments in order to construct the new regions.
These are definitely bodies of water.<p>
<li>using the function <I>h7_PointInsideRset</I>, intersect your "salty"
points with each water region to determine if the body of water is salty.
If so, merge it into a new "salty waters" region, using the region-region
union function, commencing with an empty region.<p>
<li>transform this new region into a "salt water coastlines" line set
object.<p>
</ul>

<P>intersect your <I>cities</I> point set object with this "salt water
coastlines" line set object using the proximity criterion as before.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>The items discussed in this chapter are intended to help you to better
understand how to maximize the use of Hipparchus. If there are other advanced
subjects you would like to see in future editions, please let us know.
