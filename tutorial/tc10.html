<h2>Chapter 10: Working with Satellites</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>Orbiting satellites are becoming more and more important to us. Satellites
carry incredible volumes of television, telephone and digital data
communications traffic. Satellites are also used to track ships, airplanes
and transport trucks. Satellites provide imagery of wheat fields, rain
forests, cloud cover and oil spills. And now, satellites provide the
mechanism for the Global Positioning System (GPS). Now, everyday computer
applications must know the whereabouts of satellites and what their sensors
"see". Your clients must be able to reconcile the data observed from
satellites with that obtained terrestrially, relating the two geographically.

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to outline the special functions and
considerations involved in the modeling of Earth satellite orbits and what
their sensors may "see". Hipparchus provides powerful capabilities to
correlate the position and sensor swaths of Earth satellites with Earth's
surface features.

<P>Some of the material in this chapter assumes that you have a little
knowledge of orbital mechanics. However, even if you are totally unfamiliar
with this subject, you might still want to skim through this chapter to
get a feel for this very powerful component of Hipparchus. If you want
to review some of the fundamentals, refer to the popular text <I>Remote
Sensing</I> referenced in <I>Appendix C: Bibliography</I>.

<P><h3>About Orbits</h3>

<P>Satellite orbits follow elliptical paths. Over time, an orbit traces
an ellipse. You already know that Hipparchus works with the geometry of
the ellipsoid. You also know that Hipparchus uses direction cosines and
modern vector algebra to know what's where. These same techniques can be
applied to the calculation of orbital positions. It should be no surprise
then to learn that Hipparchus provides functions to permit you to work
with orbits.

<P>Now, not only will you be able to know the location of a satellite at any
instant, you will be able to know what points on the ground can communicate
with it and what areas on the ground its sensors "see". The ability to
calculate the instantaneous relationships between a satellite and the ground
provides you with an extremely powerful tool.

<P>Defining the path of an orbiting satellite can be done in several ways.
The most common method is to define the "Classical Orbit Parameters". These
are parameters used to describe the orbit path. Hipparchus uses this standard.
Your clients may provide this information in other ways. If so, you will
first need to convert to the Classical form before attempting
to initialize the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> orbit functions.

<P>A common word associated with orbits is "period". Unfortunately, this
word has two different meanings.

<P>As one of the classical orbit parameters, "period" refers to the amount
of time taken by an elliptically orbiting satellite to complete one full
revolution. This is the definition used by Hipparchus.

<P>Alternatively, "period" is sometimes used to refer to the time taken for
successive crossings of the plane of the Earth's Equator. This is a different
value from that described above, referring to the time taken to circle the
Earth from a terrestrial point of view.

<P>To caricature the difference, consider the orbit of a typical
geo-stationary communications satellite. This is a high orbit in which the
satellite sits continually over a single point on the Earth. Viewed from
overhead the Earth, its period will be seen to be exactly one day (one
<i>sidereal</i> day, that is). But, being stationary with respect to every
point on the Earth, it will never cross the plane of the Equator and it's
"period" might be forever! (As an aside, to be geo-stationary in the first
place, it <B>has</B> to be orbiting <B>directly over</B> the Equator)!

<P>It will be important that your clients check that the "period" they
supply for a satellite is the classical one.

<P><h3>Processing Considerations</h3>

<P>Applications that include orbital calculations are well supported by
Hipparchus. You will find the relevant functions in section <I>h4</I> of the
<I>Hipparchus Library</I>.

<P>To accommodate orbital applications, you will first have to initialize a
control block, <I>orbprms</I>, with the specifications of the orbit. Orbits
are defined using the <I>h4_SetClassicalOrbit</I> and
<I>h4_OrbitPrecession</I> functions.  These are used to initialize the
<i>orbprms</i> control block (in memory). If your application works with
multiple satellites, you will need to supply orbit specifications for each
one. Please refer to the <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I> for a
complete description of these functions and their arguments.

<P>One important element of the <I>orbprms</I> control block is the "epoch".
This is literally "a point in time". Using the supplied Hipparchus functions,
you can set a starting epoch for an orbit and then successively apply a
"delta" of time after that epoch to predict "future" positions of the
satellite.

<P>The instantaneous orbital position of the satellite is provided in terms
of a location on its elliptical path. If required, your application can
convert this position to a corresponding location on the surface in the
Hipparchus sphere, typically using the functions in <I>h4</I>.

<P>Orbital positions are calculated with the same high precision as surface
positions. Precision is sub-millimetric, even for orbits as high as those of
the geo-stationary communications satellites.

<P>The Hipparchus orbit modeler is known as a "third order" modeler. This
means that it accounts for the three most significant aspects of orbital
motion: elliptical eccentricity, precession and the rotation of apsides.
(Other less significant disturbances that can affect a satellite's orbital
path are the uneven distribution of the Earth's mass, the influence of
the Moon and Sun, atmospheric drag, and so on).

<P>The orbit modeler calculates the path of an orbiting satellite in a
manner largely transparent to both you and your client. You use the same
set of functions to define its orbit and trace its path, regardless of
its eccentricity. The orbit modeler is sufficiently precise that the orbit
of most satellites can be accurately predicted for upwards of a month!

<P>Many remote-sensing surveillance satellites have what is called a "viewing
geometry". Their on-board sensors receive information about objects on or
near the surface of the Earth. For example, some satellites observe weather
patterns by sensing cloud cover, while others use side-looking radar to
detect other specific features. Using Hipparchus, you can construct a two
dimensional object that describes the sensor coverage (what the satellite
sensor "sees") over a specific time interval. This coverage is often called
the "sensor swath". An accurate definition of the swath pattern of a
satellite can be critical to an application. In addition to tracing the
surface points directly under an orbit (a <I>nadir trace</I>), Hipparchus
permits the definition of side-looking swaths.

<P>Using Hipparchus, you can easily perform the exacting calculations needed
to select only the data seen by a satellite while overhead specific regions
of interest. For example, if you are interested in data about ocean shipping
lanes, data captured by the satellite while over the Sahara Desert will
be of little interest, especially if the data acquisition and transmission
costs are high.

<P><h3>Calendar Arithmetic</h3>

<P>Orbital modeling requires us to incorporate the concept of time. Dates and
times used for orbital calculations are always expressed in terms of
Universal Coordinated Time (GMT). Orbit times in seconds since epoch are
easily expressed in the familiar terms of date and time. The <I>Hipparchus
Libraries</I> include functions that perform common calendar arithmetic
computations. All such time and date manipulations are "Year 2000
Compliant"</a>.

<p><h3>Animated Illustrations</h3>

<p>For a graphically animated illustration of the various satellite paths and
operations possible on satellite orbits and their sensor objects, refer to
<i>Galileo for Windows 95</i> and the <i>Orbits</i> script in particular.
Study of this animation and the Galileo script elements that produce it will
provide immediate insight into the power of the Hipparchus orbit modeler.

<P><h3>Other Notes</h3>

<P>One small proviso should be remembered when developing sensor swath
objects. Keep the swath object to a single orbit. This is so that the object
boundary does not cross itself and produce a computationally awkward object.
You can best create an object that consists of multiple orbits by developing
single objects for each orbit and then later taking the union of the
collection to produce the single object you are looking for.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>Satellite applications are increasingly important. Hipparchus provides an
accurate means of knowing the exact position of satellites in relation to
surface features. Remote sensor swaths can be converted to Hipparchus regions
and intersected with other objects. Using the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> orbit
functions in conjunction with the other <I>Hipparchus Library</I> functions,
satellite applications are handled with relative ease.
