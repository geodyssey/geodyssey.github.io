<h2>Appendix A: Glossary of Terms</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this appendix is to provide a list of common terms used
in this material along with a more detailed explanation of the terms. Often,
we get conditioned to $50 words when other simpler forms would serve as well.
This glossary will attempt to get back to simpler usage.

<p><dt>GUI

<p><dd>Acronym standing for Graphics User Interface, such as Windows.

<p><dt>Hipparchus

<p><dd>Perhaps the greatest of the Greek mathematicians and astronomers who
lived in the second century BC. Hipparchus invented the stereographic
projection. He is credited with the idea of representing locations on the
surface of the Earth by spherical measurements of latitude and longitude. He
is also credited with developing a method for performing distance
calculations using these angles.

<p><dt>Hipparchus Frame

<p><dd>See Hipparchus sphere, below.

<p><dt>Hipparchus sphere

<p><dd>A near-conformal (with respect to an ellipsoid of rotation) coordinate
reference system used to advantage in the Hipparchus Geopositioning System.
Point locations are expressed in normalized direction cosine form and common
distance measurements consist of the square of the spatial chord on the
co-central unit sphere. Synonymous with Hipparchus Frame.

<P>The Hipparchus sphere avoids locality restrictions and geometry
imprecisions typically imposed on systems based on "Flat Earth" geometry. On
the other hand, it affords the analysis of spatial relationships with
sub-millimetric precision sufficient for most practical applications, while
avoiding the expense of more rigorous ellipsoidal calculations when
processing large volumes of data.

faces.

<p><dt>isometric

<p><dd>Having the same dimensional measure in all directions.

<p><dt>latitude

<p><dd>An angular measurement of North/South distance from the Equator. By
convention, latitudes measured northward from the Equator are positive while
those measured southward are negative. High latitudes are those approaching
either pole.

<p><dt>LIFO

<p><dd>Last In, First Out. A term describing the operation of a particular
type of queue. This is the way that a classic stack operates.

<p><dt>line

<p><dd>An ordered set of two or more points on the surface of the Earth that
if connected together would form a line. The points are said to be vertices
of the line and successive pairs of vertices define line segments. Each
segment is a geodesic, the shortest distance on the surface of an ellipsoidal
planet. The directional sense of a line can be significant.

<p><dt>line fragment

<p><dd>That part of a line that starts in a cell and then exits that cell, or

then exits that cell.

<p><dt>line set

<p><dd>An unordered set of zero, one or multiple lines having some common
attribute. The lines of a set may intersect or be tangent to themselves or
one another. The external representation of a line set consists of ordered
sequences of global ellipsoid coordinates defining the position of each
vertex for each line. The Hipparchus internal representation is a specific
cell local coordinate form in which the individual vertices defining each
segment of each line are related to the cells visited by the lines. In
addition, the internal representation lists those cells visited (or
overflown) by the segments of the line(s).

By convention, longitudes measured Eastward are positive while those measured
Westward are negative.

<p><dt>meridian

is a specific cell local coordinate form in which each point is related
to its containing cell. In addition, the internal representation lists
those cells occupied by the point(s) of the set.

<p>In Hipparchus documentation, a point set is sometimes referred to
as a "Pset".

representation of angular measurements in mathematical calculations.

<p><dt>region

<p><dd>An area or areas of the Earth's surface containing all those surface
points that possess some common attribute. A region is defined by an
unordered set of zero, one or multiple rings defining the boundaries of the
area(s). A region is non-simply connected if it is defined by more than one
ring. Multiple rings within a set may not cross or be tangent to one another.

nesting, for example defining islands in lakes on islands, etc.

<P>The external representation of a region consists of sequences of ordered
global ellipsoidal coordinates defining the location of each vertex of
each segment of each bounding ring of the set.

<P>The Hipparchus internal representation is a specific cell local coordinate
form in which the individual vertices defining each segment of the bounding

specified explicitly but is taken to be identical with the first vertex of
the ring. Also, by definition, the segments of a ring may not intersect or be
tangent one to another.

<p><dt>ring fragment

<p><dd>That part of a ring that starts in a cell and then exits that cell, or
that enters a cell and then ends in that cell or that enters a cell and then
exits that cell.

<p><dd>A subdivision of the Earth's surface having properties corresponding
to those of a Voronoi polygon subdivision of the plane, notably that every
point contained within a particular cell is closer to the center point of

<h2>Appendix B: Galileo and Georama</h2>

<p><h3>Introduction</h3>

<i>Galileo for Windows</i> is the Hipparchus programmer's workbench
program replacing the Hipparchus Application Prototyper programs of previous
Releases. Galileo is a scriptable, interactive GIS programmer's workbench
that permits direct manipulation of application data using many of the
functions of the Hipparchus Libraries.  Besides providing
useful geographic results, Galileo is intended to provide the
programmer with source code examples of various ways and means
of incorporating geography into an application.<p>

Galileo is fully documented by the <a href="../galileo/galileo.html"
target="aside">Galileo Guide</a>. An executable for Windows is available for
download from the web at <a href="http://geodyssey.github.io"
target="aside">www.geodyssey.com</a>. The download includes numerous sample
data files and demo scripts.<p>

By contrast, <i>Georama for Windows</i> is an end-user Atlas viewer that
permits seamless browsing of World Atlas material, and includes a
number of world place-name gazetteers.  Georama processing includes
mouse-directed inspection of geographical features or events. Georama accepts
real-time inputs from a GPS receiver, providing notebook computer users with
a GPS trace log and a moving-map display.  Although directly executable from
the CD-ROM, Georama may be set up for partial or exclusive operation from a
hard disk.<p>

Georama is fully documented by the <a href="../georama/georama.html"
target="aside">Georama Guide</a>. A fully functional Georama executable is
available for download from the web at <a href="http://geodyssey.github.io"
target="aside">www.geodyssey.com</a>. The data provided with this download
provides multi-thematic coverage of New Zealand only.<p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>

Several sample programs are provided to display many of the operational
possibilities for your Hipparchus-based applications.  Recompilation of these
programs in the presence of a C/C++ source program browser can provide
valuable examples of and cross-references to working Hipparchus usage. Source
code for these programs supplied with the Hipparchus SDK may be freely cut
and pasted into your own application.<p>

<h2>Appendix C: Bibliography</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this appendix is to provide a list of other sources of
reading material that might be helpful for developers interested in expanding
their understanding of some of the subject matter.

<P><h3>Bibliography</h3>

<ol>

<li><I>Surveying Theory and Practice</I>, Davis, Foote, Anderson, Mikhail,
McGraw-Hill, 1981.

<P>This exceedingly practical book provides a basic overview of the
mathematics of surveying and mapping. The material provides detailed
explanations of practical geopositional surveying problems and techniques.<p>

<li><I>Geodesy</I>, Henry D. Bomford, Oxford University Press, Third Edition,
1973.

<P>This is a well known textbook on the subject of the measurement of all
manner of things on the Earth's surface. This could be a valuable complement
to the library of material for the serious Hipparchus developer. However,
recognize that this is a theoretical source of "last resort" for only the
ambitious. This will not likely be your first book.<p>

<li><I>Geodesy</I>, W. M. Tobey, 1928, Government of Canada Queen's Printers.

<P>This is a classic on the subject of the basic geometry of the surface of
an ellipsoid. This small book provides the classical approach to the angular
latitude/longitude computational geodesy in contrast to the direction cosine
vector approach. If you are a collector of material on the subject, you will
want to add this little gem.<p>

<li><I>Manual of Remote Sensing</I>, Second Edition, 1983, American Society
of Photogrammetry, Volumes 1 and 2.

<P>Specifically, Chapter 6 on <I>"Orbital Mechanics for Remote Sensing"</I>
by Kenneth I. Duech and Joseph C. King contains a comprehensive treatment of
the subject.<p>

<li><I>The Shape of the World, The Mapping and Discovery of the Earth</I>,
Simon Berthon, Andrew Robinson, Rand McNally, 1991.

<P>Following the immensely successful PBS television series on this subject
hosted by Patrick Stewart (second generation Captain Jean Luc Picard of the
"Starship Enterprise"), the authors captured the series content in book form.
This easily digestible material follows the evolution of knowledge and
awareness of the shape if the world since earliest time. The book is an easy
read and a great coffee table item.<p>

<li><I>The C Programming Language, Second Edition</I>, Ritchie and Kernighan

<P>This is the classic definition of the C programming language by the C
language creators themselves.<p>

<li><I>Learning to Program in C</I>, Thomas Plum, Plum Hall, 1989.

<P>This tutorial assumes that readers have absolutely no knowledge of C, and
therefore is the classic introduction to the language. Well written and
loaded with helpful examples, it is a great assist for C novices who are
trying to learn the language.<p>

<li><I>Reliable Data Structures in C</I>, Thomas Plum, Prentice-Hall, 1985.

<P>Hipparchus operates on many data structures. Your application will use
these structures for location information. The text develops the concepts of
structures, dynamic memory management, queues, stacks, doubly linked lists
and so on. The book is particulary helpful for programmers who are learning C
as a second programming language and where their first language does not have
these capabilities.<p>

<li><I>C Traps &amp; Pitfalls</I>, Andrew Koenig, AT&amp;T Laboratories,
1989.

<P>A great source of information on debugging techniques. Along with the
power and flexibility that the C language provides, come the risks of
incredibly complex code and the ensuing challenge of making it work and
keeping it working. Koenig's work has been a blessing to many.<p> </ol>

<h2>Appendix D: Geocuriosa</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this Appendix is to provide some facts and figures about
the planet Earth. And just for fun, we have also included a few historical
notes.

<P>This material is provided as a possible source of assistance or amusement
to developers working on applications involving objects on or near the
surface of the planet.

<P>Much of the material is drawn from Isaac Asimov's <i>Book of Facts</i>,
Bell Publishing Co., 1981, ISBN 0-517-38111-6.

<P><h3>Facts</h3>

<dl>

<dt><P>AREA<dd>

<P>The surface area of Earth is 196,950,000 square miles. 57,500,000 square
miles is land mass and the balance of 139,450,000 square miles is covered by
water (71%).

<P>Asia covers 17,139,000 square miles.

<P>Africa covers 11,702,000 square miles.

<P>North America covers 9,360,000 square miles.

<P>South America covers 6,894,000 square miles.

<P>Antarctica covers 5,100,000 square miles.

<P>Europe covers 4,023,000 square miles.

<P>Australia (with Tasmania) covers 2,975,000 square miles.

<P>The Pacific Ocean covers 64,000,000 square miles.

<P>The Atlantic Ocean covers 31,814,600 square miles.

<P>The Indian Ocean covers 25,298,000 square miles.

<P>The Arctic Ocean covers 5,400,000 square miles.

<P>The ancient Egyptians first developed a method for calculating area. We
are sure it will be no surprise to learn that the purpose of this was to
provide a basis for taxation. They first learned how to calculate the areas
of rectangles and triangles. They also learned how to approximate the areas
of fields with curved borders (the creativity and genius of the taxperson
knows no limits!). They learned how to measure angles and took the first
faltering steps in the development of trigonometry.

<P>The ancient Greeks collected the wisdom of many civilizations including
the Egyptians. Thales of Miteus (640? - 546 B.C.) adapted the tax assessors'
ideas and discovered some of the fundamental propositions of plane geometry.
One of his students, Anaximander (611 - 547 B.C.) prepared a map of the world
based on data from the sailors who frequented the city of Mileteus where he
lived.

<dt><P>CIRCUMFERENCE<dd>

<P>The circumference of the Earth is 24,888 miles. Eratosthenes of Alexandria
first compared the length of the Sun's shadow at the same time at Alexandria
and at Syene, about 500 miles away. Assuming the Earth to be a sphere, he
obtained an estimate of the Earth's circumference to be 250,000 stadia or
about 28,740 miles. He then drew up a map of the known world and suggested
one could sail from Spain to India "along the same parallel".

<dt><P>CITIES<dd>

<P>There are approximately 5000 cities in the world of population in excess
of 100,000 people.

<dt><P>DESERT<dd>

<P>The largest desert in the world - the Sahara - is as large as the US.
Although certain valleys in Antarctica are the driest spots on Earth, they
have more water than does any place on or above the surface of Mars.

<dt><P>DIAMETER<dd>

<P>The equatorial diameter of the Earth is 7922 miles. The distance between
the poles is 7895 miles. The difference results from the bulge of the Equator
induced by centrifugal force (of rotation).

<dt><P>ECCENTRICITY<dd>

<P>The ellipsoidal eccentricity of the Earth is about 0.34%. (See diameter
above).

<dt><P>FLAT EARTH<dd>

<P>An absurd fiction of history is that when Columbus said that the world was
round, everybody else thought that it was flat. During the debates at the
court of Queen Isabella, the true shape of the Earth was never the issue; its
size was! The opponents of Columbus said he was underestimating the size, and
that he could never sail due west from Europe to the Orient. They were
probably right. Except for his accidental discovery of an unknown continent
in between, Columbus would either have turned back or starved at sea.

<dt><P>GAS<dd>

<P>Almost every bit of Helium that exists in the world today is a product of
natural gas wells in the United States.

<dt><P>HIGHEST POINT<dd>

<P>The highest point in the world is the peak of Mount Everest at 29,028 feet
above sea level. Mount Everest is a foot higher than it was a century ago,
and it may be growing at an accelerating rate.

<dt><P>ICE<dd>

<P>About 3,900,000 square miles of the Earth's land surface (10% of the
whole) is under a permanent ice cover. 80% of all of the world's ice is in
Antarctica; 12% more is in Greenland. The remaining 8% is distributed among
various polar islands and mountain glaciers.

<dt><P>LOWEST POINT<dd>

<P>The lowest land point in the world is where the Jordan River enters the
Dead Sea, at 1290 feet below sea level. Another interpretation could be the
ocean floor in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean which is
35,810 feet below sea level.

<dt><P>MAPS<dd>

<P>An ambitious plan for an international map of the world on a uniform scale
has been proposed, but only a part of the plan has been completed. Designed
by the German Albrecht Penck, and presented to several meetings of the
International Geographical Congress (in 1891, 1909, 1913), the map would
consist of about 1500 sheets each covering four degrees of latitude and six
degrees of longitude in a modified conic projection, on a scale of
1:1,000,000.

<dt><P>PARALLELS AND MERIDIANS<dd>

<P>Hipparchus of Nicaea was one of the great mathematicians of Rhodes in the
Aegean Sea. He built an observatory there and painstakingly performed
brilliant research with the best instruments of his time. He is said to have
been the first to describe a position on the surface of the Earth in terms of
latitude and longitude. Hipparchus was also the first to observe that the
equinoxes fall a little later each year.

<dt><P>PEOPLE AND PLACES<dd>

<P>Frigid, ruggedly beautiful Patagonia, the narrowing tip of South America,
is the only populated continental land area south of 45 degrees South
Latitude. By comparison, most of Europe, Asia and two-thirds of North America
are north of 40 degrees North Latitude.

<P>Berlin and Warsaw are farther north than parts of Alaska. The
southern-most Aleutian Island, Amchitka, is at a latitude of about 51.7
degrees North, which is about the latitude of London and Calgary. Both are
farther south than Berlin or Warsaw.

<dt><P>POPULATION<dd>

<P>The current population of the world is estimated at 5.2 billion (January
1, 1990 estimate). Half of the world's population live in just four
countries: China, India, the former Soviet Union and the United States (China
alone counts for about 25% of the total). The other half live in over 160
countries.

<dt><P>RADIUS<dd>

<P>Eratosthenes, a Greek scholar and astronomer is credited with measuring
the circumference and the tilt of the Earth. When he needed to know the
distance from Alexandria to Syene, men were engaged who were trained to walk
in uniform steps and count them - the distance was about 500 miles! We use
6,371,007.1808 meters for the radius of the Earth.

<dt><P>RAINFALL<dd>

<P>The driest place on Earth is Calama, in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Not a
drop of rain has been seen there, ever!

<dt><P>ROTATION AROUND THE SUN<dd>

<P>The Earth revolves around the sun, its axis inclined at an angle of about
23 degrees to the plane of rotation. It remains inclined at almost the same
angle throughout the revolution; thus the direct rays of the sun fall on
different parts of the Earth at different times, resulting in our change of
seasons.

<dt><P>ROTATION OF EARTH<dd>

<P>In 1851, Jean Bernard Leon Foucault set up an experiment in which a
pendulum seemed to change its plane of swing slowly. Actually, the pendulum
continued to oscillate in a single plane; the Earth carrying the observer was
slowly rotating beneath it!

<P>The spinning of the Earth has an effect on moving objects: it causes them
to deflect slightly to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, or to the left
in the Southern hemisphere. The "Coriolis effect" applies equally well to a
river or a ballistic missile. But don't be fooled; its because of this
deflection to the right that bath water goes down the drain in a
counter-clockwise rotation (North of the Equator).

<P>In addition, the slow precession of the axis of the Earth's rotation has
advanced the December solstice to Sagittarius. The Tropic of Capricorn is
used to describe the geographic latitude where the sun appears overhead
because two millennia ago the December solstice was located in Capricornus
and the reference has stuck. The same is true of the Tropic of Cancer, for
the summer solstice is now in Gemini, not in Cancer.

<dt><P>SHAPE<dd>

<P>Although we have spent much time talking about various mathematical models
of the Earth, the "real thing" is quite complex. One of the best analogies
used to describe the exact shape of the Earth is that of a thick-skinned
balloon filled with water. As the balloon rotates around an its axis pulled
by forces of gravity and rotation, the equatorial points bulge out to give us
something of the "pumpkin" shape we talked about (except that the top of our
balloon looks just like the bottom, unlike a real pumpkin). To complicate our
model, we add an uneven, brittle crust to our balloon (the land mass
variations of the globe).

<dt><P>TIME<dd>

<P>Immanuel Kant suggested, in the eighteenth century, that tidal friction
slowed the rotation of the Earth. He was correct, but it could not be
demonstrated for another century. As the tidal bulge travels about the
planet, it scrapes against shallow sea bottom - especially the Bering Sea and
the Irish Sea - and the energy of the Earth's rotation is dissipated in
frictional heat enough to slow rotation and lengthen the day by one second
every 100,000 years.

<P>To go on the lunar day, merely adjust your watch to lose two minutes and
five seconds every hour.

<P>Time Zones were invented and introduced in 1884 by Sir Sanford Fleming,
engineer and surveyor of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

<P>The former Soviet Union was so wide that it encompassed eleven time zones.

<P>The most exciting cartographic discovery in this century turned out to be
a forgery - the infamous Vinland Map, "proof" that the Vikings had explored
the New World.

<dt><P>WATER AREAS<dd>

<P>Approximately 71% of the surface of the Earth is covered by water. The
Pacific Ocean fills nearly a complete hemisphere of the Earth's surface. The
oceans of the world are so vast and deep that if the Earth had an absolutely
level crust, the seas would form an envelope over 8,800 feet deep around the
globe.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>We think that the planet Earth is a fascinating place. Since most of us
are destined to spend our lives here, learning more about the place seems to
be a prudent objective. Some of the facts about our planet are truly
interesting. We would be pleased to hear from the reader regarding other
pertinent facts that we might include in this Appendix.<p>
