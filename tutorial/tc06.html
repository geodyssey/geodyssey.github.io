<h2>Chapter 6: Working With Voronoi Cells</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to provide information about Voronoi
cell structures and their importance. In particular, we will show you how to
construct your own Voronoi cell structures. Performance issues are identified.

<P><h3>Why Do You Need Voronoi Cells?</h3>

<P>Good question! You might think that if you had a good model of the Earth
and you knew your coordinates, you would need little else. While this might
be true if you had incredible amounts of data storage and unlimited amounts
of processing power, the reality is that you must carefully steward
both of these resources. One of the techniques that helps you become an
efficient consumer of computing resources is the technique of indexing.

<P>Most of your data comes to you with some inherent distribution or
"clustering". If you can develop an index that exploits this natural
clustering, your searching processes become more efficient.

<P>This is an easy concept to grasp for non-geographic data. For example, an
automated telephone book is usually a database of subscriber names, indexed
alphabetically by the first letter of the last name. In this example, you use
the alphabet as your guide to searching. An index on the first character of
the last name restricts the searching to smaller, more manageable groups. In
other words, to find a certain "Smith", you do not have to bother looking in
any other groups other than the "S" group.

<P>On the two-dimensional surface of the world the problem is much more
difficult. To cite an extreme case, if you indexed your data by latitudes
alone, you might have to inspect all your data by longitudes to find the
specific data you wanted. Or vice versa. To go back to the telephone book
example, you could index by surname or by first name, but not both at the
same time.

<P>Fortunately, there now exists a solution to this dilemma.

<P>You can now use a Voronoi subdivision of the Earth's surface to divide
up your data into smaller, more manageable "patches". You can use this
subdivision as a guide in your searching. We call each of these smaller,
more manageable "patches", a "cell".

<P>You can build any number of different Voronoi subdivisions. Each one
can be based on a different premise.

<P>For example, your <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK includes a specific Voronoi cell
structure that subdivides the Earth's surface into about 2500 or so smaller
areas having approximately equal human population. ( This is
<I>WORLDW32.VIX</I>) For areas on the Earth's surface where there are many
people, there are many small cells. In the nether regions of the planet,
where fewer people reside, there are fewer, but larger cells.

<P>We have supplied this particular Voronoi cell structure with Hipparchus
because, all other things being equal, it is people that generate data. Where
there's lots of people, there's likely lots of data; where there's not
a lot of people, there's not likely a lot of data.

<P>A second supplied Voronoi cell structure divides the Earth's surface
into a number of cells of roughly the same area (<I>ISOTYPE</I>). You
might use this structure in a situation where you had a worldwide database
of atmospheric measurements, more or less regularly spaced. You could also
use this structure (consisting of some 272 cells) as a starting point for
your own structure, further subdividing it in accordance with the expected
spatial distribution of your own data.

<P><h3>Index Power</h3>

<P>The ability to determine a "coarse" or approximate location of your
information by finding its "containing" cell allows you to speed up your
search process. Once you have located the general area of interest, you
can use other data attributes for the "fine" or detailed selection of data.
Some applications only require "coarse" indexing. For the purposes of this
tutorial, we will refer to the "coarse" location of a piece of data as
the center point of the cell containing the data.

<P>In working with information relating to the surface of the Earth (for
example, population, resources, etc.) you soon realize that there are more
dense concentrations of certain objects in some areas than in others. In
other words, you have to deal with more data about some areas (where there
are many objects of interest) and less data about other areas (where there
are fewer, if any, objects of interest).

<P>The problem is analogous to developing a payroll system in Scotland
and attempting to index the objects (i.e., the employees) by the first
letter of their last name, only to discover that almost all of the names
begin with the letter 'M'. For indexing purposes, you will have most of
your eggs in one basket and your searching performance for most names will
be less than exemplary. In Scotland, you would need another way to subdivide
the information.

<P>Historically, geographic information system designers have linked the
indexing challenge to the ages-old quest for a finely-divided <B>regular
tessellation</B> of the Earth.

<P><h3>Historic Approaches</h3>

<P>It is a little-known fact that one cannot partition the surface of a
sphere by creating a regular tessellation having more faces than those
defined by the five Platonic solids. These are:
<ul>
<li>tetrahedron - four equilateral triangular faces
<li>cube - six square faces
<li>octahedron - eight equilateral triangular faces
<li>dodecahedron - twelve regular pentagonal faces
<li>icosahedron - twenty equilateral triangular faces.
</ul>

<P>Any of these could be used to subdivide the surface into regular shapes.
For example, you could grossly approximate the shape of the Earth as a
cube. In this case, each of the six faces of the cube would be a square.
You could subdivide this square into smaller squares, numbering each "cell"
to develop your index. The problem of course is that a cube model of the
Earth is totally unrealistic.

<P>If you move up to a dodecahedron (a solid figure with twelve plane faces,
each a pentagon) you will produce a model of the Earth that has twelve
sides - better, but still an unrealistic model. It will still not subdivide
the Earth finely enough for any practical use. For example, all of North
America would be represented by only two faces of this model.

<P>You might go on and consider use of the icosahedron, but you're not
significantly ahead. Twenty faces will still not do the job.

<P>Going beyond the five Platonic solids does not help. Plato (a
mathematician as much as a philosopher) tried using simple polygons and
eventually recognized the challenge.

<P>Knowledge of this impossibility was periodically lost. In building the
St. Lawrence Dome of Florence, Michelangelo tried with triangular faces,
but he too found the limitations.

<P>The amazing Buckminster Fuller understood the problem from the outset
but nevertheless produced his "geodesic" dome. He did this by compromising.
He specified the faces of his dome to be of differing shapes and sizes.

<P>In the computer age, the quest to find a regular tessellation of the
Earth has been far from academic. The idea has been that if you had such
a grid, you might be able to come up with a formula that could directly
transform a point's coordinates into a multi-level disk address. This would
then get you directly to the specific "bit bucket" that contains data about
the point.

<P>Although much has been written on this subject, most investigators have
come to accept that a regular subdivision of the surface of the Earth is
not possible - all attempts so far having proven fruitless.

<P>So what are the alternatives?.

<P>For indexing purposes, if you were to abandon the regular tessellation
idea and deliberately move towards an <I>irregular tessellation</I>, you
might assume that you would encounter both good and bad.

<P>The major gain would be your ability to match each cell size with the
density of the associated data. The major loss would be an easy formula
for locating the bucket containing an object based on its global position
coordinates alone. In other words, you could develop an index that was
matched to the natural spatial distribution of your data, but you could
expect significant additional complexity and computing inefficiencies in
finding that data.

<P>But are these assumptions actually justified?

<P>Consider next the contribution of Voronoi.

<P><h3>Understanding Voronoi</h3>

<P>The Russian mathematician M. G. Voronoi was the first credited with
the description of an interesting irregular tessellation of the plane.

<p>He observed that using elementary "ruler and compass" geometric
construction, you could divide a flat surface into a network of polygons
having very significant properties.

<P>Voronoi observed that if you took an arbitrary set of points on a flat
surface (such as a map), and you connected certain points with a straight
line, and you then drew the bisectors of these lines, what you got were
polygons enclosing each point.

<P>Even though there might be a potentially very large number of point
connector lines, their bisectors formed "horizons" around the points such
that a relatively small number of bisectors formed convex polygons surrounding
each point.

<p><IMG SRC="tf07.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 Border=1>

<p>Figure 7 illustrates a number of Voronoi polygons and some of the geometry
used to construct them.

<P>These irregular figures on the plane are called Voronoi polygons. Once
constructed, they have this significant property:

<P><B><i>A point that falls within one polygon will, by definition, be closer
to the center point of that polygon than the center point of any other
polygon.</i></B>

<P>Put differently, once you have defined such a polygon, all of the objects
closer to its center than the center of any other polygon can be considered
to be exclusively "owned" by that polygon.

<P>This provides an informal definition of the Voronoi polygon. It is useful
to note in passing that its center point is distinct from its centroid.
For more precise definitions, refer to <I>Appendix A: Glossary Of Terms</I>.

<P>Voronoi published his observations near the turn of the last century.
Others (Theissen, Delaunay, Dirichlet) have extended his observations and
applied them for practical use by geographers and other map users.

<P>Now back to the story line.

<P>If you were hunting for an <B>irregular</B> tessellation of the round
Earth, you might think of Voronoi polygons. Could they somehow be wrapped
like a fish net around the entire surface of the Earth, defining an
ellipsoidal Voronoi-like polygon structure with properties analogous to its
planar form? If so, could they serve as a spatial index?

<P>In the development of Hipparchus, the investigation of this possibility
was combined with the development of a vector algebra for ellipsoidal
geodesy. There were at first unsubstantiated indications that the assumed
disadvantages of the irregular tessellation approach could be minimal and
that the advantages significant. The resulting product now speaks for itself.

<P>Because of its parallel with what was described by Voronoi, we call
our global spatial index a <B>Voronoi cell structure</B> and we call the
individual "polygons" <i>Voronoi cells</i>, or just plain <i>cells</i>.

<P><IMG SRC="tf08.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<p>Figure 8 shows an orthographic view of a simple Voronoi cell structure,
illustrating the fact that it surrounds the entire Earth.

<p>Voronoi cell structures are central to the entire fabric of Hipparchus.

<p>As an aside, when you look at one of these cell structures, you may be
reminded of the appearance of biological cell structures as seen under a
microscope. The next time you are at a zoo, consider the pattern on the
neck of the Reticulated Giraffe. Hasn't Mother Nature a fascinating way of
anticipating our view of things?

<P><h3>Facts About Voronoi Cell Structures</h3>

<P>First (and foremost), you need only the coordinates of the cell center
points and lists of their neighbors to completely define the entire cell
structure.

<p>You need only these coordinates to determine the geometry of
the cell boundaries. So there is no need to store the boundaries.
If you ever need to display them, you can generate them "on the fly".
(In most other irregular grid systems, such as quad trees,
you would be forced to store (and retrieve) the
coordinates of the corners of the "bounding boxes").

<P>You can build any number of different Voronoi cell structures. Ideally,
each one you build will reflect the natural geographic distribution of
your application data. For efficiency, a greater density of data points
in an area should be matched by a greater density of cells in that area.
Figure 9 illustrates a population-related Voronoi cell structure coverage
of the world (in the Mercator projection).

<P><IMG SRC="tf09.gif" HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM>

<P>If the density distribution of your data changes over time, you will
be able periodically to restructure its cell index.

<P>Note that if your data is static, you might never need to adjust your cell
structure. One cell structure may suffice for the life of the application
data. This could apply also to applications using periodically updated static
databases such as those distributed on CD-ROM media.

<P>As a rule of thumb, the number of cells in your structure should be
three to four orders of magnitude less than the number of points that will
be indexed by that structure. For example, if you are working with a database
of a million point positions, you might effectively deploy an indexing
structure of one thousand cells.

<P>In the context of Voronoi cell structure, you need only know the
coordinates of a given point to determine its "home" cell. To find that
cell, you must calculate the distance of your point from the center points
of all the cells in the structure. Your point will belong to the cell whose
center point is the shortest distance from that point.

<P>On the face of it, this procedure suggests an unacceptable
amount of calculation. However, using the vector algebraic approach plus some
of the heuristic principles of virtual memory management, Hipparchus starts
the search with the home cell of the previous point addressed and then goes
on from there to locate the new home cell.

<P>Knowing the "neighbors" of a given cell would obviously be very useful
in the search process. It should be no surprise then that Hipparchus knows
all about a cell's neighbors. For each cell, Hipparchus has already built a
list of neighbors. On average, each Voronoi cell has about six of them.

<P><IMG SRC="tf10.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>

<p>Figure 10 shows a somewhat closer view of the previous population-related
Voronoi structure. Note that each cell carries a unique identifier, a simple
integer. Application data elements assigned to cells will associate with
this identifier.

<P>Now that you know the basic geometry of Voronoi cell structures,
you need to know how to select one for your specific requirements.

<p><h3>Selecting a Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>You have at least five options in selecting the appropriate cell structure
for your application:
<ol>
<li>use one of the supplied structures, as is
<li>modify one of the supplied structures
<li>harmonically subdivide one of the supplied structures
<li>"densify" one of the supplied structures
<li>custom-build your own structure.
</ol>

<P>We will next investigate each of these options.

<P><h3>Using an Existing Cell Structure</h3>

<P>The <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK includes three ready-to-use
Voronoi cell structures.

<P><I>ISOTYPE</I> is a basic structure that is based on a dodecahedron model
of the Earth that has been "harmonically decomposed" three times to provide
higher resolution. This structure consists of some 272 cells of approximately
equal area. It is suitable "as is" for global physical models not requiring
a great deal of data.

<P><I>WORLDW32</I> is a structure that is related to the population densities
of the world. It consists of nearly 2500 cells of sizes somewhat inversely
proportional to the human populations in the areas. It is useful "as is"
for global applications that work with data associated with human activity,
but in relatively small quantities.

<p><i>USAW32</i> is a structure that is related to the population densities
of the USA and its territories.

<p>To assist in the rapid deployment of your application, Geodyssey offers a
collection of pre-built Voronoi cell structures for these and other parts of
the world at varying densities. These may be viewed and freely downloaded
from our <a href="http://www.geodyssey.com/voronoi/voronoi.html">website
repository</a>.

<P>Additional sources for ready-made cell structures would include other
applications that address similar data. Since Voronoi cell structures are
independent of specific application data, they can be exchanged easily
between applications, and even between computing platforms.

<P>However, if your application is new, uses a lot of data, or is
geographically localized, you will likely want to develop your own structure.
This need not delay you. For development purposes, you can get started with
one of the supplied structures and replace it later with your own.

<P><h3>Modifying An Existing Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>If you are developing an application that deals almost exclusively with
information about a specific local area such as a municipality, then
you will likely need to augment one of the supplied global cell structures
with a large number of small cells in the vicinity of your application
area.

<P>If this is the case, you might run the <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i>:
<i>CELLPTS</i>, <i>CLUSTER</i>, <i>CELLCAT</i> and <i>CELLWVS</i> against the
minimal structure <i>ISOTYPE</i> to produce a new structure having the
desired density of cells in the specified localities, but sparse cells
elsewhere.

<P><IMG SRC="tf11.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>

<p>Figure 11 illustrates just such a structure for an application with
spatial data centered in the lower New York state area.

<P><h3>Harmonically Subdividing An Existing Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>If your data is geographically distributed with the same relative
distribution as that implied by an existing Voronoi cell structure, but is
far too voluminous to be effectively indexed or manipulated using that
structure, then you can "harmonically" divide the existing structure to
provide another having approximately three times the number of cells, but the
same relative distribution.

<P>You do this by running the <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> program
<i>CELLPTS</i> with the "add corner points" option, followed by
<i>CELLWVS</i>.

<P><IMG SRC="tf12.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>

<p>Figure 12 illustrates the first harmonic subdivision of the <i>ISOTYPE</i>
structure.

<P><h3>Densifying an Existing Cell Structure</h3>

<P>If you wish to adapt one of the initial cell structures to your needs,
and none of the above procedures seems appropriate, you can follow the
steps outlined below:
<ol>
<li>Select one of the supplied cell structures<p>
<li>Get together a set of representative application location points
to be used to "influence" the modification of the structure<p>
<li>Modify the supplied cell structure using the <i>Hipparchus
Utilities</i> program <i>CELLDNS</i>.<p>
</ol>

<P>The actual operation of this program is described in detail in the
<I>Hipparchus Utilities Guide</I>. Here we will only discuss what is meant by
"influence".

<P>Using the densification method of cell structure modification, you do
<B>not</B> specifically select cell center points. Instead, you provide
the <I>CELLDNS</I> program with a "representative" distribution of "for
instance" data locations. You also specify the maximum number of these
representative data elements that any cell should be forced to contain.
On this basis, the program tallies cell "hits" and keeps dividing cells
until all would contain at most the maximum specified representative points.

<P>Hopefully, the relationship between the total number of representative
data locations and the maximum number per cell will reflect what you expect
in real life. The actual amount of representative data you use in this
process can only affect the precision of your data distribution forecast.
Time permitting, you conceivably could use your whole location database
as input to this process.

<P>For example, for an extended <I>CITIES</I> application, you might start
with the <I>WORLDW32.VIX</I> cell structure and influence it with locations
of specific manufacturing facilities and more precise demographic location
data. This would be appropriate for an application that does market
penetration analysis for products targeted at consumer markets.

<P>In another example for a Western Canadian petroleum application, you
could start with <I>ISOTYPE</I> and influence it with the location
of every oil well drill site in the Province of Alberta.
This procedure would approximate the information density associated
with the Alberta oil and gas industry (for example, pipelines, exploration
leases, roads, drill sites, etc.). The oil well drill site points will
not themselves become cell center points. Instead, the site locations are
used to influence the creation of a new structure of cells. Figure 13
illustrates the intricate cell structure obtained in this manner.

<P><IMG SRC="tf13.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>

<P>If you were to zoom in on any of the more dense areas, you would see
a precisely defined structure having zero-width imaginary cell boundaries.
Figure 14 shows this view in the vicinity of the city of Calgary, Alberta,
Canada.


<P><IMG SRC="tf14.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>


<P>In yet another example, a municipal engineering application, you
could start with <I>ISOTYPE</I> and influence this structure with the survey
control points for the municipality. These will often reflect the density of
information in the municipality (for example roads, sewers, power lines,
population, traffic, etc). You would end up with a highly localized
structure that still met the requirement that all cell structures
be global in their coverage (see Figure 15, following).

<P><IMG SRC="tf15.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>

<p>Nevertheless, each of these small cells serves to efficiently classify the
relatively large amount of spatial data available for the locations. Figure
16 (following) illustrates some aerial survey data in the neighborhood of the
Calgary Zoo.

<P><IMG SRC="tf16.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=400 border=1 ALIGN=TOP>


<P><h3>Custom-Building A Voronoi Cell Structure</h3>

<P>The process to custom-build your own cell structure is deceptively simple.
Just follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Develop a list of point locations you want to use as cell center
points for your cell structure<p>
<li>Process this list using the <i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> program
<i>CELLWVS</i>.<p>
</ol>

<P>Of course, the more difficult part is in deciding on the list of cell
center points! There are a number of important factors to be taken into
account. These are discussed at length in <I>Chapter 12: Advanced Topics</I>.
We recommend that you defer this option until you are more familiar with
the relationships between a cell structure, your geographic objects
and the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> functions.

<P>For the moment, suffice it to say that once you know where your cell center
points are to lie, actually constructing the Voronoi cell structure is
easy.

<P><h3>Multiple Cell Structures</h3>

<P>In most cases, you will need only one cell structure for your application.
For example, in a Texas petroleum application, you might use the well drill
site locations to develop the cell structure. This data is clustered nicely
such that over 75% of the wells are located in the southeastern half of
the state. Hence, you might find perhaps 500 wells in a 10 square mile
area near Houston and less than one well per 10 square miles near El Paso
to the West. You will likely use this natural data clustering to develop your
Voronoi cell structure.

<P>In some cases, however, you may want to have more than one cell structure
available to your application. This could be the case if your application
works with multiple "themes". Suppose, for example, that in addition to
the petroleum theme, your application had grain transportation as another
theme. Then you could be working with the locations of grain elevator
facilities and branch rail lines. You might opt to index your data about
these grain transportation facilities under a second Voronoi cell structure.

<P>Now, if your application were to try to combine or compare geographic
information from both themes, you would need to have both structures defined
simultaneously.

<P>Hipparchus allows you to do this. With each Hipparchus function call,
your application passes a reference to the appropriate cell structure.

<P>You must remember that to calculate the logical intersection or union
of any two objects, both objects must be represented in memory under the
same cell structure. It is an easy matter to move an object from one cell
structure to another before performing a logical operation. See the functions
for local to global conversions <I>h6_CellToGlobal</I> and
<I>h6_GlobalToCell</I> in the <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I>.

<P><h3>Cell Structuring Recommendations</h3>

<P>Working with cells, it is important to recognize that there are some
important "do"s and "don't"s to be considered. The most common are these:
<ol>
<li><B>Don't</B> attempt to position cells such that their boundaries
are aligned in any specific way. Not only is this exercise counter-productive,
it's next to impossible to achieve.<p>
<li><B>Don't</B> try for a nice geometrically regular distribution of
cell center points. Regularity is the anathema of Hipparchus cell structures.
Avoid this temptation. Don't even <I>think</I> of trying to line up adjacent
cell center points on the same parallel of latitude or meridian of longitude.
We recommend that you stick initially to structures derived from the supplied
ones.<p>
<li><B>Do</B> be aware that if your cell structure does not generally match
your data density, you could be in for some processing inefficiency. If your
application seems slower than planned, you should check out this possibility.
You can easily update your cell structure to more closely match the data
densities. You can do this later, however, when your application database
grows.<p> <li><B>Do</B> remember that Hipparchus demands full coverage of the
Earth's surface, even when your application works only with one small region.
This is no problem since the other portions of the Earth will merely have
sparse or no data. For example, you might have 10,000 cells to cover Texas
and only a few hundred or so for the balance of the world. Nevertheless, when
planning your database, be sure to remember these "offshore" cells.<p> </ol>

<P>For more information about these admonitions, consult <I>Chapter 12:
Advanced Topics</I>.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>Voronoi cell structures are the key to indexing your data. For a quick
start, you can use one of the supplied ready-to-use cell structures. However,
if none of these are directly usable, you can easily modify one of them
to create your own cell structure. If necessary, you can custom-build your
own structure. You can have multiple structures in use simultaneously.
We have made a number of general recommendations that should help you when
working with cells.
