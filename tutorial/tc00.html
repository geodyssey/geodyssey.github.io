<h2>Preface</h2>

<P><h3>About Hipparchus</h3>

Hipparchus <I>(pronounced hip-ARK-us)</I> was perhaps the greatest of
the ancient Greek astronomer mathematicians. The inventor of latitudes
and longitudes, he used these measurements to calculate distances on the
surface of the Earth. As you learn more about this software product, you
will soon see why we named it as we did.

<P><h3>About This Publication</h3>

<p>The <i>Tutorial</i>, (short for <i>Hipparchus Tutorial and Programmer's
Guide</i>), is currently presented in HTML format only, on the web at <a
href="http://www.geodyssey.com">www.geodyssey.com</a>, and as a part of all
subsequent Hipparchus SDK distributions. If you are viewing this document on
the web, please understand that any hyperlinks to components of the
<i>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</i> are resolvable only in the context
of a properly licensed Hipparchus Software Development Kit (SDK).

<P>The purpose of the <i>Tutorial</i> is to acquaint you with Hipparchus
concepts and its programmer's facilities. We will focus on helping you with
the design of application systems using the <I>Hipparchus Libraries</I> of
functions. We will try to explain the who, what, why, how, when and where of
Hipparchus. The material presented will cover the following topics:<p> <ul>
<li>what is Hipparchus <li>what is included with the package <li>what
computing environment is needed <li>how do you use the <I>Hipparchus
Libraries</I> functions and utilities <li>how do you interface Hipparchus to
other software products. </ul>

<P>Although this publication is not intended for everyone, we have made some
effort to make the material readable by most. But its content is designed for
a particular audience.

<P><h3>Intended Audience</h3>

<P>This publication is intended to be used by computer application
development professionals who will be working with the <i>Hipparchus</i>
Geographic Software Tools, (or are otherwise considering it).

<P>We occasionally make reference to graphical user interface and database
management software. Readers are assumed to have some knowledge of these
subjects, or have access to others that have it.

<P>In addition, you are assumed to have a reasonable familiarity with
traditional positional coordinate systems (latitude and longitude),
measurement systems (imperial and metric) and certain simple mathematical
terms. We will make frequent reference to these items. A glossary of terms
and a list of reference reading are provided to help you bridge any gaps. An
effort is made to provide popular analogies and real life examples to help

<P>Although we may at times gloss over some of the rigor associated with
the underlying mathematics of the subject matter (called computational
geodesy), be assured that the software provides precise treatment. For
most, this should suffice. If you have a need to understand the underlying
premises and theory, we recommend that you review the cited references.

<P><h3>How To Use The Tutorial</h3>

<P>The <i>Tutorial</i> is organized to lead you along a gradual learning
curve (we hope).

<P>The following is a reading guide to the <i>Tutorial</i>:

<P><I>Chapter 1</I> introduces <i>Hipparchus</i>. This is a must for all
readers.

<P><I>Chapter 2</I> describes the computing platform requirements. If you
plan to put Hipparchus to work immediately, study this chapter carefully.
Otherwise, you might just skim it for its general content.

<P><I>Chapter 3</I> describes the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> material. This
chapter is for the programmer. If at this stage you are only interested
in concepts, you might review only the first section or two of this chapter.

<P><I>Chapter 4</I> gets you started using Hipparchus. This chapter is
for the C or C++ language programmer. However, if you have any programming
experience at all, you might benefit by a cursory glance at this chapter.
Alternatively, you could flip to <I>Appendix B</I> and work with some of
the pre-programmed sample programs provided.

<P><I>Chapters 5, 6 and 7</I> introduce important design concepts. These
chapters are a must for all application architects, regardless of their
programming skills or background.

<P><I>Chapter 8</I> describes the Hipparchus Utilities and several
pre-programmed file options that are available for use by developers,
(and others).

<P><I>Chapter 9</I> addresses the role played by Hipparchus in supporting the
graphical presentation of geographic data. This chapter should be read by
anyone planning a graphical user interface to their application.

<P><I>Chapter 10</I> addresses satellite orbit modeling. This chapter
is for anyone planning to work with satellite data. No programming skills
are required.

<P><I>Chapter 11</I> reviews debugging techniques. This chapter is strictly
for the programmer.

<P><I>Chapter 12</I> contains information on advanced topics. This chapter
is mainly for the working Hipparchus application developer.

<P><I>Appendix A</I> is a glossary of terms. If you run across
an unfamiliar word or acronynm, try finding it here.

<P><I>Appendix B</I> references several of the sample applications provided.

<P><I>Appendix C</I> provides some bibliography.

<P><I>Appendix D</I> provides some facts about planet Earth.

<P><I>Appendix X</I> provides an index to this publication.


<P><h3>About Our Company</h3>

<P>Geodyssey Limited is a privately-owned corporation based in Calgary. The
firm is dedicated to the promulgation of Hipparchus Technology. The sole aim
of the organization is the marketing, distribution and support of Hipparchus.
As owner of the exclusive worldwide rights to Hipparchus, we are committed to
provide our customers with quality new products and top-flight support.

<P>To help you apply the full power of Hipparchus, Geodyssey Limited
periodically offers hands-on customer training courses in major cities of the
world. In addition, should you or your company require related application
development assistance, we can supply experienced Hipparchus analysts and
programmers to assist you directly. Hipparchus has been carefully crafted to
meet most geographic application needs. Nevertheless, should your application
require special treatment or enhancements, Geodyssey will be pleased to
provide product extensions.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>We realize that some of the concepts we have already introduced via this
<i>Tutorial</i> may be quite new and different. This is a challenge we have
attempted to overcome. We recognize that some readers will struggle with the
specifics. It should be no surprise then if you discover that the
<i>Tutorial</i> is not the kind of book that can be read lightly, such as
something that you might read on a commuter plane. Absorbing the material
presented will require some of your valuable time, and more particularly,
will test your powers of concentration.

<P>We encourage you to run the Windows 95/98/NT demonstration programs:
(<i>Columbus</i>, <i>Galileo</i> and <i>Georama</i>. This will accelerate
your ride up the learning curve. Do you remember when you were first
introduced to the concept of "programming"? This new idea was strange at
first, but at some magic moment the light went on and you have "owned" the
concept ever since. Watch for similar magic moments as you make your own
voyage of discovery through Hipparchus.

<P>Enjoy this voyage. See our world on your computer screen and move about as
if you were on a magic carpet floating high above the oceans and continents.
Drop down to the surface and pinpoint the relative locations of all manner of
things and events. Skim across the terrain with a new multi-dimensional
measuring tape of amazing flexibility and accuracy. Revel in the thrill of
solving problems that foiled the ancient scholars, and even some of our best
contemporary minds at that.

<P>Envision yourself building startling new computer applications with ease,
speed and precision. A stunning array of powerful new tools for business,
engineering, government and the mass consumer market now awaits creative
developers. And there's newly garnished data to power such applications.

<P>An ancient Chinese philosopher once said "The journey of a thousand
miles begins with a single step". Take that first step now on your journey
of discovery through Hipparchus. Immerse your mind in the words that follow.
