<h2>Chapter 5: Design Concepts</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to review some of the basic things you
may want to consider when you are designing your application and planning
your geographic database.

<P><h3>Approaching the Application Design</h3>

<P>For most applications, a review of the data is a first step in the design
process. The structures and formats of that data will have an enormous
effect on the solution to the problem that you have been given. For the
purposes of this tutorial, we will not attempt to reproduce or replace
the many excellent texts on this subject. Rather, in this chapter we will
assume that you will have at least some experience with database design.

<P>Given a problem to solve (for example, "I need a list of all of the major
cities in the world that are within 50 miles of an ocean or large lake"),
you first must look at the problem in detail. As usual, the problem itself
is somewhat ill-defined but you will likely need to decide:
<ul>
<li>what data is needed
<li>where to get the data
<li>how to input the data
<li>how to process the data
<li>how to present the results.
</ul>

<P>In the example problem, you will want to know just what constitutes
a "major city". This could be defined by population, number of square miles
covered, etc. Similarly, you will need to know what is meant by "large" lake.

<P>As an experienced developer, you ask "Why does the client want this list"?
There may be additional questions soon to follow. Since your company
distributes sports fishing equipment you might guess that additional questions
will have something to do with markets, sports fishing and new product lines.
You might therefore anticipate subsequent questions, such as:

<ul>
<li>which of these cities have a population greater than x?
<li>which of these cities have sports fishing manufacturers?
<li>which of these cities are near salt water?
<li>and so on.
</ul>

<P>If you are clever, you will likely design an application where the end
user can sit at a workstation and ask these questions interactively.
The user could choose to adjust her/his definitions of "major" as well
as develop other questions. For example, "How many of the cities are within
50 miles of a <B>salt water</B> coastline"?

<P>If answers to such questions could be displayed quickly on the screen
and the user could move around the globe in search of answers of evolving
clarity, you would have done a reasonable job as a developer. The data
attributes needed to answer these auxiliary questions might be of importance
during the data acquisition process as well as the data modeling process.

<P>Not too surprisingly, data considerations are a major element for each
step in the application development process. The following outlines some
of the typical data concerns you probably need to address.

<P><h3>Types of Data</h3>

<P>In general, there are five categories of data that make up a database:

<ol>
<li>Physical measurements - this includes any form of measurement or
count. Typical attributes include geographic location, height, weight,
length, time, population, density, mass, volume, pressure, etc. These are
measured in appropriate units and represented with appropriate resolution.<p>
<li>References to other tables - usually defined identifiers such as
employee number. For example, in a payroll system, an employee number in
a pay register may identify an entry in another table that contains the
employee's age, address, telephone number, position, etc.<p>
<li>Monetary data - usually measured in a specific currency (for example,
US dollars) and represented with a specific resolution (for example, dollars
and cents).<p>
<li>Free-form descriptive material such as text (for example, "This area
is considered as a wildlife sanctuary under legislation enacted in 1967
by ...".<p>
<li>Multi-media material such as images, audio, video, etc.<p>
</ul>

<P>Of these five categories of data, Hipparchus works with
data of the first and second categories listed above.
<p>Hipparchus deals almost exclusively with the attributes of geographic
position. Only in specific instances does Hipparchus carry other data "along
for the ride". For example, a digital elevation model (DEM) application will
almost certainly associate directly the elevation datum with the surface
coordinates of each observation.  More typically, however, you will associate
your geographic location data with other data by means of cross-references.
In such cases it will be these cross-references that Hipparchus will carry
along internally. (You saw an example of this in the tutorial program
<I>CITIES</I>. There, pointers to the cities file records were carried as
part of the <I>cities</I> point set and subsequently propagated into the
derived point set <I>cities_subset</I>). Typically, it is your application
that provides the glue that binds your geographical and non-geographical
data.

<P><h3>Typical Data Concerns</h3>

<P>Typically, you will need to be concerned about several aspects of your
location data. You will need to find out the following:

<ul>
<li>its source
<li>its volume
<li>its currency
<li>its integrity
<li>its precision
<li>its geographic distribution.
</ul>

<P>For your application, you should decide (after discussion with your
clients), the following:

<ul>
<li>the accuracy requirements
<li>the speed of response required
<li>the form of display or hard copy
<li>the retention of calculated data.
</ul>

<P><h3>Understanding Location Data</h3>

<P>Much of the positional data that we know today is described either directly
or indirectly in terms of latitude and longitude. For example, our
Geodyssey's current home office is located at N51:02:45 W114:04:48 (WGS84).
(This is read as North latitude 51 degrees, 2 minutes, 45 seconds and
West longitude 114 degrees, 4 minutes, 48 seconds). In planning your
logical data model, these coordinates will be two of the attributes in the
physical measurement category. Their nominal external precision will be known
and reflected by the location data: degrees alone, degrees and minutes,
degrees, minutes and seconds, etc.

<P><h3>Geodetic Datum</h3>

<P>When looking at a source of geographic location data, you may need to
be aware of its "geodetic datum". Field surveys that generated
that particular set of location data were performed using a specific
frame of reference. You may need to know more about that frame of reference.

<P>The surveyor's frame of reference has two interdependent parts: the
ellipsoid and the datum:

<h4>The Ellipsoid</h4>

<P>Latitude and longitude positional measurements are NOT spherical.
They are ellipsoidal measurements. For example, whoever surveyed your town's
boundaries calculated specific latitudes and longitudes according to
an ellipsoidal model of the Earth. Over the years, the increasing
sophistication of geodetic engineering has led to the specification of a
large number of ellipsoidal models. They are well known to surveyors and
other professionals concerned with the measurement of the Earth's surface.

<P>Hipparchus has the computational specifications for some 34 ellipsoidal
models, some historical and some currently in use. You can choose one of these
or supply your own model. You do this using the <I>h4_SetEllipsoidParameters</I>
function. To get an idea of the numeric differences between these reference
ellipsoids, consider the physical location of a point having a particular
latitude and longitude. Under a change of the reference ellipsoid, the
apparent location may be altered by as little as one meter or by as much as
several hundred meters.

<h4>The Datum</h4>

The central element of the surveyor's frame of reference is the datum. This
is a reference to a specific network of relatively few, but also relatively
high precision position observations, adjusted on a regional or continental
basis to account for differences between adjacent observations of specific
features. These are known as <i>control points</i>. The agreed adjusted
position of these control points forms the basis for a hierarchy of agreed
regional and local positions, such as benchmarks and other monuments. In
practice, the main body of local survey data is based on observations of
distances and angles to or from nearby monuments and benchmarks.

<p>Since the adjustment of network control points varies from one
region to another, reconciliation of local observations recorded under
different datums can be done only by computationally intensive local
comparison and statistical inference rather than by a mathematical
transformation between reference ellipsoids. If your application demands such
a reconciliation, plan on consulting an experienced survey professional!

<P>In different parts of the world, surveying is practiced more or less
independently, often without reference to the same ellipsoids and,
most certainly, without reference to the same datums. Historic survey
reports for positions on different continents (or at sea) are therefore
basically incommensurate. Distances and angles between such data must be
understood to be approximate.

<p>The good news is that modern satellite and astronomic survey techniques
promise a new generation of accurate, high-volume, commensurate position
information, reconcilable both locally and globally!

<P>If your application demands high precision and you do not know the frame
of reference for your source data, you will have an important question
to resolve before commissioning the application. However, if you are less
concerned about precision or cannot immediately determine the frame of
reference, you should select one of the more recent models (e.g., for the
tutorial example we used model number 34, "World Geodetic System, 1984").

<P>For a complete discussion of this subject, we suggest you refer to
<I>Surveying Theory and Practice</I> described in <I>Appendix B: References</I>.

<p><h3>"Flat-Earth" Coordinates</h3>

<p>A widespread method for the expression of local positional data is a pair
of "flat-Earth" (x-y) positional coordinates giving a location in one of the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or "state plane" projections. Just as for
latitude and longitude coordinates, the nominal external precision of these
"flat-Earth" coordinates will be known and reflected by their units of
measure: meters, millimeters, etc.  Although expressed as planar "flat-Earth
coordinates", they are usually derived indirectly from survey observations
based on a specific ellipsoid and datum.

<P><h3>Logical Data Design</h3>

<P>Once you have learned more about your problem and the nature of the
data involved, you can set about to develop your logical data model. Using
the sample question regarding the "major cities within 50 miles of an ocean
or large lake", you might look for information sources that would help answer
your questions.

<P>Let us assume that you have located the data that provides the information
that you need to answer the initial question. The data might logically
be represented as columns in two relational database tables:

<P>Cities table:<ol>
<li>Name
<li>Location
<li>Population
</ol>

<P>Coastline vertices table:<ol>
<li>Coast
<li>Vertex number
<li>Vertex location.<p>
</ol>

<p>In a conventional relational database, these tables could be be
intersected on their common column, <i>location</i> to yield a list of
cities lying on a coast, but only if their was an explicit and exact match of
location attributes. So what is the reason for mentioning this logical data
modeling approach?

<P>The reason is that with the power of the Hipparchus spatial operators, you
can logically combine such tables to come up with the answers to questions
such as those posed in our hypothetical sport fishing equipment manufacturing
example. In fact that's exactly what we did in <I>Chapter 4: Getting
Started</I>.

<P>As conjectured earlier, you anticipate some additional questions about
population, sports fishing equipment manufacturers and salt water. You have
located additional information that might be useful. Logically, it might look
like this:

<P>Sports Fishing Equipment Manufacturer Table:<ol>
<li>Name of manufacturer
<li>Name of city
</ol>

<P>Water Salinity Measurements Table:<ol>
<li>Geographic location
<li>Salinity reading
</ol>

<P>In the example, you now have four logical tables of input data. With
these tables alone, you ought to be able to use Hipparchus to find answers
to the additional questions anticipated.

<P>Logical object manipulation is one of the great strengths of the Hipparchus
approach. In the tutorial example, you asked for a form of logical
intersection of a point set object and a line set object. Now let us explore
more generally just what makes up an object.

<P><h3>Hipparchus Objects</h3>

<P>Hipparchus objects are the building blocks or "variables" used to calculate
spatial relationships between things, conditions or events. Hipparchus
objects are of course only an abstraction of reality. They nevertheless
convey the whereabouts of things. They can represent the position of things
that exist on the surface of the Earth, below the surface, in the atmosphere,
or in the near space surrounding the Earth.

<P>Objects are not constrained in any way by geography. They may be used to
describe things as large or as small as you need to model the features you
have in mind.

<P>Hipparchus works with three types of objects:
<ul>
<li>dimensionless objects (points)
<li>one-dimensional objects (lines)
<li>two-dimensional objects (areas).
</ul>

<P>More precisely, Hipparchus works with three canonical forms of these
objects: point sets, line sets and regions (bounding ring sets). With these
three basic forms you can describe almost any geographic feature imaginable.

<P>A <b>Point Set</b> object (Pset) may consist of a single point or a group
of points. For example, in the tutorial program <I>CITIES</I>, you
constructed a point set consisting of the locations of a set of cities. You
then derived a new object which was the subset of cities meeting the
proximity criterion. Other examples of point sets are:<ul> <li>a set of
weather reporting locations <li>a set of post office locations <li>a set of
survey monuments. </ul>

<p>As mentioned, the set of points may consist of just one point. The set may
also be empty.

<P>A <b>Line Set</b> object (Lset) is defined by <B>ordered</B> sets of point
locations. Any two successive point locations define a line segment. Segments
are "straight" lines (geodesics). Two or more segments define a line. The
points are said to be vertices of the line. A line has directional
<B>sense</B>: a line from A to B is distinct from a line from B to A. A line
set object may consist of a group of zero, one or more lines. Examples
include the following:<ul>
<li>a line defining the USA/Mexico border
<li>a set of lines that define the coastlines of the world
<li>a directed line defining the track of a moving vehicle
<li>lines that define equal barometric pressure (isobars)
<li>lines that define satellite sensor visibility limits.
</ul>

<P>A <b>Region</b> object (Rset) consists of an area of interest that has some
specific characteristics. The term "region" is somewhat synonymous with
"boundary ring set". A region is defined by ordered sequences of points
forming closed rings. The region being defined lies on the left side of the
directed line forming the ring. The region may be "not simply connected" which
means that you can define multiple rings (for example, an island group) or
rings within rings (for example, an island in a lake on an island). Examples
of regions include:<ul>
<li>an area of market influence
<li>an area seen by a satellite over a specified time
<li>an area constituting an island group
<li>an area of glacial coverage
<li>an area bounded politically.
</ul>

<P>Working with these three primary classes of objects, you can create
new objects, such as the following:
<ul>
<li>cities within 50 miles of a world coastline
<li>shipping lanes seen by a particular satellite
<li>states of the United States that are wholly landlocked.
</ul>

<P>Once you have developed the initial objects from your data, creation
of new objects based on spatial unions and intersections is an easy task
using the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> functions for object manipulation.
These are found in section <I>h7</I> of the <I>Hipparchus Library</I>.

<P>This topic is revisited in <I>Chapter 7: Refining Your Design</I>.

<P><h3>Modeling Objects</h3>

<P>Modeling can sometimes be described as an art form. In using a powerful
tool like Hipparchus we suggest that you follow the golden rule of modeling:

<P><B><I>Always model reality rather than a model of reality</I></B>

<P>In other words, it is better to create a direct model of the physical
world rather than a model of another model already derived or conceived.

<P>For example, if you have a set of meteorological reporting locations
that provide temperature and pressure, the golden rule tells you to create
an object based on the measurement points themselves, rather than one based
on isotherms or isobars. Isotherms and isobars are developed by others as
models of the weather situation. If you know how, isobars and isotherms can
be created "on-the-fly" at any time. They are merely objects derived from
physical observations made at specific geographic points. (Of course, if you
have no ready access to the observational data, you may have to make do with
published isotherms and isobars).

<P><h3>Geographic Image Data</h3>

<P>Many geographic applications deal with image data. Our definition of
geographic image data includes:
<ul>
<li>photographs of the Earth's surface
<li>satellite-sensed images of the surface
<li>scanned or otherwise digitized maps.
</ul>

<P>In some applications, you may wish to use such image data as a visual
reference for your users, permitting them to identify the geographic locations
of specific image features or to create vector objects by tracing with a
mouse. For example, a ship's captain might want to know the precise latitude
and longitude of an iceberg seen in a satellite image of Davis Straight. In
another example, a forester might want to trace on an aerial photo the
proposed routing for his logging trucks.

<P>Hipparchus provides functions that let your users adjust the plane of
the display so that it coincides approximately with the arbitrary plane
of a bit-mapped image. Then, using standard Hipparchus unmapping functions,
mouse coordinates can be projected back to the surface of the ellipsoid, and
a vector data object created. As you might expect, you can also display other
vector data in this arbitrary plane, overlaying the reference image.

<P>In other more complex image processing applications, you may be processing
each pixel of the image, adjusting shades of grey or false color. Should
your application require geographic alignment of image data on a pixel
by pixel basis, then Hipparchus can be used to advantage. In such cases,
the image data likely would be treated as a point set vector object. This
is discussed later in this chapter and more extensively in <I>Chapter 7:
Refining Your Design</I>.

<P>In any case, Hipparchus can provide significant benefits in indexing such
image data. With Hipparchus, you will be able to dramatically accelerate
geographic image retrieval times. This capability in explained in <i>Chapter
6: Working with Cells</i>.

<P><h3>Physical Data File Design</h3>

<P>When implementing applications with Hipparchus, you communicate with
Hipparchus entirely via memory structures. The <I>Hipparchus Library</I>
functions will know nothing about your external data files. So, part of your
physical data file design must necessarily deal with how your data is going
to be organized once it's been brought into memory. You should address this
issue first, then tackle the external file design. Memory modeling
considerations may influence dramatically your external physical database
design. Of course, you will probably do a bit of both before firming up your
plans.

<P>The first thing you will need to know for your memory design is the
maximum number of data items you will need to deal with at any one time.
The second thing you will need to know is the precision required for the
location attributes. Externally, location attributes may be expressed in a
wide variety of formats and precisions. However, once brought into memory
for processing by Hipparchus, location items will be represented by a very
limited number of canonical forms, ranging from a maximum of thirty-two bytes
per point or vertex to a minimum of just two bytes per point or vertex.  This
topic is addressed in detail in <I>Chapter 7: Refining Your Design</I> and
again in <i>Chapter 12: Advanced Topics</i>.

<P><h3>External File Design</h3>

<P>You will next need to consider the form that your data should have in
its external storage medium (for example, hard disk). This does not have
to be the same as the form it takes when in memory for processing. There
are of course a large number of factors to consider when deciding on an
external database design.

<P>Since you communicate with Hipparchus via internal memory structures
only, your external design is not dictated by Hipparchus. You are free to
organize your external data in whatever way seems best, using whatever
file system or DBMS you like.

<P>Your design for the external data store could be critical to achieving
performance goals, especially if the application is designed to interact
with the user. For this reason, we will address some of the design issues that
can significantly affect the overall performance of your application.

<p><h3>Static Versus Dynamic Location Data</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, by far the largest volume of geographic location
data is static. Examples of static location data are terrain elevations,
bathymetry, coastlines, rivers, lakes, administrative boundaries and
historic events or observations.  Although perhaps occasionally updated,
these objects typically remain unchanged for the life cycle of the
applications employing them. And, if updated, the new versions can be
imported into the application in their entirety, replacing the earlier
versions. The original object data file creation and subsequent updates, if
any, will typically be performed by batch processes, off-line from the
application. The application will generally treat such objects as read-only,
so their integrity is seldom an issue, nor is simultaneous multi-user access
an issue.

<p>Considering the foregoing, we strongly recommend the use of simple
file system solutions for the design of your static external application
data. (Remember that your static geographic location data can be linked
to other more dynamic application data located in other files or databases
via simple "tag-along" attribute references such as flight or sales office
identifier).

<p>By contrast, consider some examples of application location data that is
clearly dynamic. Almost any location data that pertains to current or planned
human activity and events will be dynamic in nature. Examples of such objects
are: satellite trajectories, aircraft flight plans, shipping orders, sales
distribution, demographics, etc. These are typically small in their
geographic extent or data volume.  Applications that deal with such objects
will likely need to consider on-line (or at least frequent off-line) data
update procedures and all that go with them: backups, permissions, record
locking, referential integrity, etc.

<p>Even here, if the data volumes are not daunting, you might well consider
the use of simple flat file solutions, relying on the use of text editors or
simple application procedures to enforce the access or update rules.

<p>Only if the data volumes are very large or the update and access rules
very demanding should you consider the use of an orthodox Data Base Management
System (DBMS) for the external storage of your application's geographic
location data.

<p><h3>Flat Files</h3>

<p>Whether your application geographic location data is static or dynamic,
you should consider the use of simple "flat files". These might be
appropriate in instances where either the object count or point/vertex
volume is modest or where the planned use of objects mandates that they be
brought into memory in their entirety. (Both of these conditions applied in
the simple application introduced in <i>Chapter 4: Getting Started</i>.
Flat files can be ASCII or binary. If they are to be shared with other
applications, then ASCII would be better. But if they are to be used only by
the one application on a single platform type, and if the point/vertex is
higher, then a binary record format might be considered.

<p><h3>Hipparchus Binary Objects</h3>

Another binary file option that may be open for consideration is the use of
"Memory Mapped" files. In this option (if offered by your operating system),
you may treat the application external objects as persistent memory objects
that are mapped into your computer's virtual memory disk swap space. Such
objects may be considered by an application to be either static or dynamic.
(Both the <i>Galileo for Windows 95</i> workbench and the <i>Georama for
Windows 95</i> Atlas programs demonstrate the use of such files).

<p>Even very large Hipparchus Binary Objects may be processed <i>in situ</i>,
without the need to be brought in to memory in their entirety.  This means
that very large objects (such as the the supplied "Dry Land of the World"
region object) can very efficiently be intersected with a user display window
or any other local selection region.

<p>For Hipparchus Binary Objects, the only limitation to size or complexity
is the host system's virtual memory disk swap space allocation.

<P><h3>Spatial Indexing for Your External Data</h3>

<P>If your application geographic location data is at all voluminous, you
will need a plan for the creation and maintenance of an effective indexing
mechanism. This is a method for quickly finding specific data that is stored
externally.

<P>Your application may have indexing requirements that are independent
of your data's location attributes. For example, in a personnel application,
data about people would normally be indexed by the person's name, not by
the person's location.

<P>The chances are, however, that if your application deals with geographic
relationships, you will need to index at least some of your data by location.
This is called "<B>spatial indexing</B>".

<P>The construction of an efficient spatial index is possibly the most
critical design factor for your application. This alone may "make or break"
the practicality of your planned application. Hipparchus offers significant
performance advantages in this important aspect of your application design.

<p>In <i>Chapter 7: Refining Your Design</i> we introduce a number of
simple indexed file options that require only the basic C/C++ run-time library
stream i/o facilities. But whether you opt for one of these simple file
designs or for a more generalized DBMS, you will need to understand your
options for a spatial index, which are introduced in
<I>Chapter 6: Working With Cells</I>, following immediately.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>General application development rules apply. The incorporation of
location-specific information using Hipparchus is relatively straightforward.
You convert your location information into the internal Hipparchus notation.
Geographical objects are modeled as point sets, line sets or regions. These
objects can be of unrestricted size and complexity. Objects can be
manipulated with ease. Your data can be stored externally in many ways using
simple flat files, memory-mapped files, simple indexed stream i/o files
or a DBMS of your choice. For high-volume external application location data,
its spatial indexing may be the most important performance issue.
