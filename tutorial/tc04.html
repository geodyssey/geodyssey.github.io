<h2>Chapter 4: Getting Started</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to get started by developing a complete
application using Hipparchus. As Plato said, "We learn by doing". So let's
do it! (If you are not a programmer or perhaps lack access to the required
C/C++ language programming development environment, you may still benefit by
study of this chapter).

<P><h3>The Pieces of the Puzzle</h3>

<P>For this application, you will need the following:

<ul>
<li>Details of the specific problem to solve
<li>An appropriate computing environment:<br>
    hardware, operating system and C/C++ compiler/linker
<li>Hipparchus development tools</I>
<li>Relevant data
<li>Other support material.
</ul>

<P><h3>What We Supply</h3>

<P>Your Hipparchus Software Development Kit (SDK) provides:

<ul>
<li>The <I>Hipparchus Library</I> of functions (binaries)
<li>The <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> of functions (source)
<li>C language header files to support the above libraries
<li>The <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I> (in HTML)
<li>Several Voronoi cell structures (in ASCII format)
<li>World coastlines, city locations and other vector data
<li>The tutorial source program (<I>CITIES.C)</I>
<li>Utility programs (in source form)
<li>The <i>Hipparchus Utilities Guide</i> (in HTML)
<li>Other programs and demonstration scripts
<li>This <I>Hipparchus Tutorial and Programmer's Guide</I>.
</ul>

<P><h3>First Steps</h3>

<P>To get started, we recommend the following steps:

<ol>
<li>If you have access to an Intel computer with Windows 95/98/NT,
be sure to run the <I>Galileo for Windows 95</I> program and its supplied
data and demonstration scripts, beginning with the <i>Tour</i> script.<p>

<li>First, you must establish the <I>Hipparchus Source Materials</I> in your
C/C++ language development environment (as appropriate).<p> <li>Then you must
establish the selected <I>Hipparchus Library Materials</I> version binaries
in your object program linker environment. <p> <li>Following the README.315
notes accompanying the <I>Library Materials</I>, you should then compile,
link and run the "smoke test" applications, <I>BENCHMRK.C</I> and
<I>CITYLIST.C</I><p> <li>Optionally, using the <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary
Library</I> source materials, you should compile a local <I>HIPPAUXL.LIB</I>
auxiliary library, again after first consulting the README.315 notes.<p>
<li>Review this chapter, then compile, link and run the supplied tutorial
program (<I>CITIES.C)</I>.<p> <li>Refer to the support material as needed.<p>
</ol>

<P>Running the Hipparchus "smoke tests" will assure you that the <I>Hipparchus
Library</I> has been correctly located and that your development environment
is set up properly.

<P>If you want to integrate Hipparchus with your chosen development tools
(DBMS, GUI, etc.), we suggest that you first consult the reference material
for those products. The source for the sample application programs
accompanying Hipparchus (such as <I>GALILEO</I> and <I>GEORAMA</I>) will
demonstrate a number of ways in which Hipparchus can be integrated with the
Windows 95/98 or NT4+ graphic environments. With the source code of these
programs as a guide, the integration of Hipparchus with a specific GUI should
be relatively easy.

<P><h3>Tutorial Application 1: <I>CITIES</I></h3>

<P>Suppose that you are an application developer supporting the marketing
department of a sports fishing equipment firm. The marketing folks always
have interesting new problems for you to solve. Today, they have asked you
for help on a critical new marketing initiative.

<P><I>Problem: Find the names of major cities in the world that lie within
50 miles of an ocean or major lake.</I> Your objectives are clear.

<P>Given some experience with Hipparchus, you are justifiably confident
of quickly providing the answers. You make up a plan for the application.
In "pseudo-code", it looks like this:

<ol>
<li>Define program parameters and variables
<li>Allocate and initialize Hipparchus workspace
<li>Read in an appropriate Voronoi cell structure
<li>Read world coastlines data and construct a line set object
<li>Read in world cities data and construct a point set object
<li>Find the cities that are proximate to the coastlines
<li>Print the results, clean up and finish.
</ol>

<P>The following material will expand on each of these steps, illustrating
one way you could write a C/C++ language program for this application. Note
that this tutorial application will assume clean data and no graphical user
interface. Real world applications would of course need additional
"bullet-proofing" for actual use. Our intent here is only to show how simple
it is to use Hipparchus to build the application.

<p>For easy cross reference to the functions and structures we'll be using,
you may at this time want to point your Internet Web browser to the start of
the <i>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</i>, which starts with a HELP file
called "Intro.htm".

<P><h3>Step 1: Define Variables and Allocate Workspace</h3>

<P>For openers, you must refer to a set of headers as shown below:<pre>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                  /* standard input output header */

/* Hipparchus Library definitions for:                              */

                                    /* - system and other constants */
                                         /* - elementary data types */

                                           /* - function long names */
                                           /* - function prototypes */
                                                        /* - macros */
#include &lt;hipparch.h&gt;

/* Hipparchus Auxiliary Library definitions                         */
/*        - additional definitions to support selected h0 functions */

#include &lt;hippttys.h&gt;
</pre>

<P>Since you are only going to print out a list of the cities, your program
is going to be very simple in the input/output department. Yes, your
application would be a lot more exciting if you could see the world
coastlines on a color screen and have the major cities within 50 miles of big
bodies of water highlighted in a different color. It would also be exciting
to move around the globe and zoom in on the cities of Europe or Asia. But
you've got to crawl before you walk! You can add these enhancements later.

<P>Next, you define a few parameters and constants for your program and
supply the prototype for your <I>main</I> function. If you don't want to
copy the requisite input files into your current directory, you may wish
to modify the statements that define the manifest constants TIX_PATH,
COASTLINES_PATH and CITIES_PATH. Alternatively, you could override these
items from the command line at run time.<pre>
/* Program global definitions                                       */

#define TIX_PATH "isotype.tix"        /* path to Voronoi index file */
#define COASTLINES_PATH "coast.lns"      /* path to coastlines file */
#define CITIES_PATH "cities.pts"             /* path to cities file */

#define WGS_84 34                                /* ellipsoid index */
#define WORKSPACE 100000                /* workspace for engine use */
#define PROXIMITY 50                 /* proximity criterion (miles) */
#define MILES_TO_METERS 1609.344               /* conversion factor */

#define LINE_LENGTH 256      /* max line length for data file input */
#define ITEM_LENGTH 128     /* max item length for character string */

/* Program file function prototypes                                 */

int main(int, char **);                  /* main function prototype */
</pre>

<P>In the next part, you begin by declaring your <I>main</I> function and
then declaring the various local variables and structures that will be
referenced in the body of the program. These will be described as we go
along.<pre>
/* ================================================================ */

/* Main Program                                                     */

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

   struct ellprms eparms;     /* structure for ellipsoid parameters */

   struct vix_dscr vxd;      /* Hipparchus Voronoi index descriptor */

   struct wrk_dscr wkd;          /* Hipparchus workspace descriptor */

   struct hp1d coast_lines;     /* world coastlines line set object */

   struct hp0d cities,             /* world cities point set object */
               cities_subset;           /* derived point set object */

   void *workspace;                            /* workspace pointer */

   FILE *file_ptr;                          /* generic file pointer */
   long record_ptr;                          /* file record pointer */

   char tix_path[128] = TIX_PATH,             /* Voronoi index path */
        coastlines_path[128] = COASTLINES_PATH,  /* coastlines path */
        cities_path[128] = CITIES_PATH;              /* cities path */

   double proximity = PROXIMITY;     /* specified proximity (miles) */

   char record[LINE_LENGTH];  /* storage space for one input record */

   char item_a[ITEM_LENGTH],            /* parser extraction string */
        item_b[ITEM_LENGTH],            /* parser extraction string */
        item_c[ITEM_LENGTH];            /* parser extraction string */

   char *string_ptr;   /* generic pointer for character string work */

/* Pointers to stack or queue elements containing the               */

                  *queue1_tail;     /* specific line set queue tail */

/* Pointers to stack or queue elements containing                   */
/* point/vertex global direction cosine coordinates                 */
/* plus associated arbitrary data or a pointer:                     */

   struct ptmp_gld *city_ptr,      /* generic ptr to a city element */
                   *stack1_top,       /* specific stack top pointer */

   struct s_vct3 location;              /* direction cosines vector */

   int result;    /* for receiving int values returned by functions */
</pre>

<P>Next, you begin the executable part of the program. First, you put out
a message announcing commencement of the program. Then you process any
optional command line override parameters. (For your first test of the
program, you should check the default settings by running without any of
these parameters specified).<pre>
/* -----------------------------------------------------------------*/

   fprintf(stdout, "%s:\n"
    "Find cities in proximity to coastlines.\n", argv[0]);

/* Optional overrides of default pathnames and proximity            */
   if (argc > 1) {
      strcpy(tix_path, argv[1]);
      if (argc > 2) {
         strcpy(coastlines_path, argv[2]);
         if (argc > 3) {
            strcpy(cities_path, argv[3]);
            if (argc > 4) proximity = atof(argv[4]);
            }
         }
      }
</pre>

<P>Next, you must allocate and initialize some memory workspace for Hipparchus
internal operations. To do this you use the Hipparchus functions <I>h1_Malloc</I>
and <I>h6_WorkspaceInit</I>. <I>h1_Malloc</I> is a pass-through function,
the equivalent of the standard <I>malloc</I>, provided in this form so that
you can (if necessary) port your code by substituting for <I>h1_Malloc</I>.
<I>h6_WorkspaceInit</I> requires three parameters, the address of a workspace
descriptor block, a workspace pointer and the size (in bytes) of the
workspace. (For a complete discussion of these and other related functions,
see the <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual)</I>. Your workspace
allocation statements will look like these:<pre>
/* Allocate work space for internal use by the Hipparchus engine.   */
   workspace = h1_Malloc(WORKSPACE);
   if (workspace) h6_WorkspaceInit(&wkd, workspace, WORKSPACE);
   else {
      fprintf(stderr, "1. Insufficient heap memory available.\n");
      exit(1);
      }
   fprintf(stderr,  "Hipparchus workspace allocated.\n");  /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<P>On our advice, you allocate 100,000 bytes of storage for your workspace.
This is not an unreasonable amount of space. It will be used internally
by the higher-level Hipparchus functions (<i>h6</i> and above). Later on in
<I>Chapter 7: Refining Your Design</I> you will learn how this
requirement can be estimated.

<P><h3>Step 2: Initialize Ellipsoid Parameters</h3>

<P>Scientists have established a number of ellipsoidal models of the Earth.
You need to either pick one of these or supply your own.

<P>Hipparchus will be calculating positions and distances on the basis
of the specific model you choose. To begin, you must allocate space for
and then initialize a table of ellipsoidal geometry parameters. For the
tutorial example, you can assume that the application requires the <I>World
Geodetic System 1984</I> ellipsoidal model (not that it matters that much
for this application). You initialize your table using the
<I>h4_SetEllipsoidParameters</I> function. This requires three arguments:
<ul>
<li>a code for your chosen ellipsoid
<li>a pointer to a structure that will receive the ellipsoid parameters and
<li>a pointer to an area that is to receive a character string identifying
the ellipsoid.
</ul><pre>
/* Set ellipsoid parameters to a specific model.                    */
   h4_SetEllipsoidParameters(WGS_84, &eparms, NULL);
   fprintf(stderr, "Ellipsoid parameters set okay.\n");    /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<P>The manifest constant <I>WGS_84</I>, set to 34 in the preamble, selects
standard ellipsoid number 34. The structure <I>eparms</I> will receive
the ellipsoid parameters. The structure type <I>eparms</I> is defined in
<I>hipparch.h</I>. The third argument, <I>NULL</I>, indicates that you
are not interested in the ellipsoid's name.

<P><h3>Step 3: Load Voronoi Cell Structure (Cell Index)</h3>

<P>Hipparchus comes with several pre-defined Voronoi cell structures. Each
of these provides a complete coverage of the Earth.  As you'll see later
on, there can be any number of Voronoi cell structures, each of which may
be defined externally in at least three distinct formats. The one we'll
use for this application is called <I>ISOTYPE.TIX</I>. To establish the
cell index in memory, you simply invoke the <I>h0_LoadTix</I> function
as shown below. This dynamically allocates heap memory, loads the external
cell index structure file and updates a small pre-allocated Voronoi index
descriptor (<I>vxd</I>). You need only provide the <I>h0_LoadTix</I> function
with the opened filename of the external Voronoi cell structure, the address
of a receiving Voronoi index descriptor and an allocation method
indicator.<pre>
/* Load Voronoi cell structure.                                     */
   file_ptr = fopen(tix_path, "rb");
   if (file_ptr == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr, "2. Unable to open file %s\n", tix_path);
      exit(1);
      }
   result = h0_LoadTix(file_ptr, &vxd, H6_RTBL_ALLOC_WHOLE);
   if (result) {
      fprintf(stderr, "3. h0_LoadTix error %d.\n", result);
      exit(1);
      }
   fclose(file_ptr);
   fprintf(stderr,
    "Voronoi cell structure loaded okay.\n");              /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<P><b>NOTE:</b> The function <I>h0_LoadTix</I> is a member of the
<I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I>. The prototype for this function is
defined in <i>hippttys.h</i>. If you have already compiled your own version
of <I>HIPPAUXL.LIB</I>, you should include it in your compiler/linker's
library path.  Otherwise, you should append a copy of the <I>Hipparchus
Auxiliary Library</I> source file <I>H0LTIX.C</I> to the <I>CITIES.C</I>
source file.  While you are at it you may as well append copies of
<i>H0PARS.C, </i><i>H0CSAA.C</i> and <i>H0FVIX.C</i>. They are the source
files for <i>h0_ParseString</i>, <i>h0_StringToAngle</i> and
<i>h0_FreeVix</i>, respectively, referenced later. Their prototypes are also
defined in <i>hippttys.h</i>.

<P><h3>Step 4: Load World Coastlines and Convert To An Object</h3>

<P>The <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK provides a ready-to-use set
of points that describe the major coastlines of the world. The data is
supplied as a file of ASCII information. The file consists of a set of
latitude/longitude records. Each coordinate pair represents a point on
a coastline. Points taken in sequence form the outline of an "island",
"continent" or "lake". Each sequence is terminated with a special marker
record having an asterisk ("*") in its first position. You can read this
data one record at a time and use the Hipparchus parser <I>h0_ParseString</I>
to pick out the latitude/longitude coordinates for each point. Of course,
you must check for the asterisk to detect the end of each piece of coastline.
Back-to-back asterisk marker records signal the end of the line set. In
this example you can just read ahead to the end of the file, assuming that
the back-to-back markers are there.

<P><B>Note:</B> the sample code presented in this tutorial makes use of
dynamic memory management and linked-list queuing techniques. We will not
be explaining these techniques in this tutorial. If you find that you need
help in this area, we recommend the text by Thomas Plum described in <I>Appendix
C: Bibliography</I>.

<P>For each line of the set, you convert these coordinates to the internal
Hipparchus notation, placing the results onto a "queue". Line and line
set ending markers go on the queue too, identified as such by the <I>UNDEF</I>
entry.

<P><B>Note:</B> You use a "queue" here because your data is <B>ordered</B>
in a specific way. You want Hipparchus to work with it in the same order
you read it from the external file. In the context of Hipparchus the term
"queue" means specifically a "first in, first out" (FIFO) singly-linked
list, usually comprised of elements allocated from the system memory heap
using <I>h1_Malloc</I>.<pre>
/* Read text file of line segment coordinates for a line set        */
/* defining the most significant coastlines of the world.           */
/* Isolate the latitude/longitude coordinates for each vertex.      */
/* Convert coordinates to internal Hipparchus global form.          */
/* Stash line segment vertices in a FIFO memory queue.              */

   file_ptr = fopen(coastlines_path, "rt");
   if (file_ptr == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr,
       "4. Error in opening file %s\n", coastlines_path);
      exit(1);
      }

   queue1_head = queue1_tail = NULL;   /* initialize queue pointers */
   while (string_ptr = fgets(record, LINE_LENGTH, file_ptr)) {
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_a, ITEM_LENGTH);
      if (*item_a == '*') {            /* detect line ending marker */
         location.di = UNDEF;          /* encode line ending marker */
         }
      else {
         string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_b, ITEM_LENGTH);

/*       Convert coordinates to radian measure.                     */

/*       Check the coordinates.                                     */
         if (global_coordinates.lat == UNDEF) {
            fprintf(stderr, "5. Error in latitude item.\n");
            exit(1);
            }
         if (global_coordinates.lng == UNDEF) {
            fprintf(stderr, "6. Error in longitude item.\n");
            exit(1);
            }

/*       Convert ellipsoidal global latitudes/longitudes to         */
/*       Hipparchus sphere conformal direction cosines              */
         h4_EllipsoidToHpsph(&eparms, &global_coordinates, &location);
         }

/*    Allocate heap space for vertex queue element.                 */
      vertex_ptr =
       (struct ptmp_gl *)h1_Malloc(sizeof(struct ptmp_gl));
      if (vertex_ptr == NULL) {
         fprintf(stderr, "7. No more heap space available.\n");

</pre>

<P>With the coastline data now enqueued in memory, you then pass the name
of the queue to the Hipparchus line set constructor to build a Hipparchus
line set object representing the world coastlines.<pre>
/* Now convert internal queue of coastlines to a line set object    */
   result = h7_GlobalToLset(&vxd, &wkd, NULL, &coast_lines, 1, 0,
    H_FLOAT_RES, 1, (struct ptmp_gld *)queue1_head);
   if (result > 0) {
      fprintf(stderr,
       "9. GlobalToLset error %d.\n", result);
      exit(1);
      }

   fprintf(stderr, "Coastlines converted okay.\n");        /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<P>The constructor function <I>h7_GlobalToLset</I> takes nine operands
which you might review in the <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I>.
Note here however that the reference to the queue element pointer
(<I>queue1_head</I>) has been cast to conform with the type of the operand
defined in the prototype. This is because these queue elements are of type
<I>struct ptmp_gl</I>, a subset of type <I>struct ptmp_gld</I>.

<P>Since you won't need the queued data any longer, you can remove it.<pre>
/* Free the coastlines point queue, element by element.             */
   while (queue1_head != NULL) {
      vertex_ptr = queue1_head;
      queue1_head = queue1_head->next;
      h1_Free(vertex_ptr);
      }
</pre>

<P><h3>Step 5: Read List Of Cities</h3>

<P>Now, you need to read in your list of cities together with their locations
and other information. The <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK
provides a file of ASCII data describing the locations and place names
of cities of the world. For each city, you need to convert the latitude
and longitude to the internal Hipparchus notation. You use nearly the same
process you used to read in the world coastlines data. For each city, you
will parse, convert and enqueue its location information. You will also
have to capture and set aside for possible later use its record pointer
within the cities file. You can ignore any markers in this file. Since the
order of the cities is unimportant to Hipparchus, you can use a somewhat
simpler form of queue called a "stack".

<P><B>Note:</B> A "stack" is actually a "last in, first out" (LIFO) singly-linked
list. In the context of Hipparchus, a "stack" should not be confused with
the system memory stack which is used mainly to pass function arguments
and accommodate automatic variables. In fact, you will usually allocate
the elements of such "stacks" from the system heap, <B><I>NOT</I></B> the
system stack, using <I>h1_Malloc</I>.<pre>
/* Read text file of city locations and names.                      */
/* Parse latitudes and longitudes and convert to internal form.     */
/* Associate city record file pointer with city coordinates         */
/* Build a LIFO stack of major city locations and file pointers.    */

   file_ptr = fopen(cities_path, "rt");
   if (file_ptr == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr, "10. Unable to open file %s.\n", cities_path);
      exit(1);
      }

   stack1_top = NULL;                      /* initial stack element */
   record_ptr = 0L;                       /* initial record pointer */

   while (string_ptr = fgets(record, LINE_LENGTH, file_ptr)){

      if (*string_ptr == '*') continue;          /* discard markers */

/*    Extract the latitude element.                                 */
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_a, ITEM_LENGTH);

/*    Extract the longitude element.                                */
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_b, ITEM_LENGTH);

/*    Convert the location coordinates to radian measure.           */
      global_coordinates.lat = h0_StringToAngle(item_a, "+Nn", "-Ss");
      global_coordinates.lng = h0_StringToAngle(item_b, "+Ee", "-Ww");

/*    Check the coordinates.                                        */
      if (global_coordinates.lat == UNDEF) {  /* check for bad data */
         fprintf(stderr, "12. Error in latitude item.\n");
         exit(1);
         }
      if (global_coordinates.lng == UNDEF) {  /* check for bad data */
         fprintf(stderr, "13. Error in longitude item.\n");
         exit(1);
         }

/*    Convert global lat/long coordinates to internal notation.     */
      h4_EllipsoidToHpsph(&eparms, &global_coordinates, &location);

/*    Allocate heap space for "stack" element.                      */
      city_ptr =
       (struct ptmp_gld *)h1_Malloc(sizeof(struct ptmp_gld));
      if (city_ptr == NULL) {
         fprintf(stderr, "14. No more heap space available.\n");
         exit(1);
         }

/*    Enqueue "stack" element.                                      */
      city_ptr->s_point = location;       /* insert location coords */
      city_ptr->datum.l = (hipp4_uint)record_ptr; /* record pointer */
      city_ptr->next = stack1_top;             /* set next item ptr */
      stack1_top = city_ptr;                             /* set top */

      record_ptr = ftell(file_ptr);          /* get next record ptr */

      }               /* end of while loop for cities input process */

   fprintf(stderr, "Cities input completed.\n");           /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<P>Now you can convert this stack of point locations into a Hipparchus
point set object. As was the case for the line set constructor, the point set
constructor <I>h7_GlobalToPset</I> takes nine operands. Note that in this
case, the ninth operand was not cast.<pre>
/* Convert the "stack" of city points into a point set object.      */
   result = h7_GlobalToPset(&vxd, &wkd, NULL, &cities, 2, 0,
    H_FLOAT_RES_DATA, 0, stack1_top);
   if (result > 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "15. Point set creation error %d.\n", result);
      exit(1);
      }
   fprintf(stderr, "Cities point set object okay.\n");     /* DEBUG */
</pre>

<p>Since we're finished with the city points input stack, we can now delete
it<pre>
/* Free up the cities input stack, one by one                       */
   while (stack1_top != NULL) {
      city_ptr = stack1_top;
      stack1_top = stack1_top->next;
      h1_Free(city_ptr);
      }
</pre>

<P><h3>Step 6: Find The Cities That Are Proximate To A Coastline</h3>

<P>Now that you have your world coastlines and city locations in the Hipparchus
internal set notation, you can use the <I>h7_PointUxLset</I> function to
select those cities that satisfy the "within 50 miles of a coastline" criterion.
You are asking for a point-line intersection of the two objects with a
defined proximity criterion. You need to supply the following parameters:
<ol>
<li>a reference to a Voronoi cell index structure descriptor
<li>a reference to a Hipparchus workspace descriptor
<li>an optional reference to a memory area to receive the new object,
    if other than the system heap
<li>a reference to the ellipsoid parameters structure
<li>the operator type <I>H_AND</I> (meaning select points nearer to the
    line than the specified proximity criterion)
<li>the proximity criterion (distance in meters)
<li>a reference to an object header that is to receive pointers to the newly
    derived object (a point set object)
<li>an object-id and class for the new object
<li>the internal format option for the new object
<li>a reference to your point set object (the cities)
<li>a reference to your line set object (the world coastlines).
</ol><pre>
/* Apply the proximity criterion to derive a new object which       */
/* will be a subset of cities that are proximate to coastlines.     */

   fprintf(stderr,
    "Now checking for proximity to coastlines ...\n");     /* DEBUG */

   result = h7_PsetUxLset(&vxd, &wkd, NULL, &eparms, H_AND,
    proximity * MILES_TO_METERS, &cities_subset, 3, 0,
    H_FLOAT_RES_DATA, &cities, &coast_lines);
   if (result > 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "16. PsetUxLset error %d.\n", result);
      exit(1);
      }
</pre>

<P><I>h7_PsetUxLset</I> will build the new object in the Hipparchus workspace,
allocate space for the resultant object, copy it onto the heap, update
the object header <I>cities_subset</I> and return the result status. If
the function encountered any difficulties, such as running out of space
in the Hipparchus workspace or on the heap, it will return a positive non-zero
value. If the return value is -1, it means that the function found no points
in proximity to the line set and has created a valid empty point set. Otherwise,
the resultant new point set object will contain a subset of the points
in the input point set, which remains unchanged. Note that the datum associated
with each of the selected points, a pointer to the selected city's record in
the cities file, has been copied into the new object.

<P>If you think about it, you might realize that this set operation involves
a very large number of distance calculations. For each of over 300 cities,
Hipparchus will potentially have to calculate a proper geodetic distance
to the closest point of about 1400 coastline segments. This multiplies
to a very large number of mathematical calculations, so be prepared to
wait a moment for the results.

<P>Since we no longer need the input point or line set objects, and since
they were allocated on the heap, we can release their memory using
<I>h7_ReleaseHpobj</I>. Note that the object header structures (hp0d, hp1d)
are NOT de-allocated by this process, but their internal pointers to the
objects' substructures are NULL'ed.<pre>
/* Release the canonical coast_lines and cities objects.            */
   h7_ReleaseHpobj((struct hpobj *)(&coast_lines));
   h7_ReleaseHpobj((struct hpobj *)(&cities));
</pre>

<P><h3>Step 7: Print The Results And Finish</h3>

<P>To work with your set of results, namely the new object <I>cities_subset</I>,
it is probably simplest here to convert it back to its global form as a
stack of point coordinates and related name pointers. You do this with
the <I>h7_PsetToGlobal</I> function, providing a reference to a pointer
variable to receive a pointer to its top. Now it will be a simple matter
to traverse the stack, extracting city records and printing them, on the
fly. Note that the result of a successful <I>h7_PsetToGlobal</I> is a
count of the number of points enqueued (which may be zero).<pre>
/* Convert derived point set to a stack of global coordinates.      */
   result = h7_PsetToGlobal(&vxd, NULL, &stack2_top, &cities_subset);
      if (result &lt; 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "18. Derived PsetToGlobal failed.\n");
      exit(1);
      }

/* Release the derived cities point set object.                     */
   h7_ReleaseHpobj((struct hpobj *)(&cities_subset));

/* Print report heading                                             */
   fprintf(stdout,
    "\n%d cities within %d miles of a coastline:\n",
    result, (int)proximity );

/* Traverse the cities sub-set stack                                */
/* retrieving records of the selected cities and                    */
/* printing out the names of the selected cities,                   */
/* releasing the stack space on the fly.                            */

   while (stack2_top != NULL) {
      record_ptr = (long)stack2_top->datum.l;
      fseek(file_ptr, record_ptr, 0);
      string_ptr = fgets(record, LINE_LENGTH, file_ptr);
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_a, ITEM_LENGTH);
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_b, ITEM_LENGTH);
      string_ptr = h0_ParseString(string_ptr, item_c, ITEM_LENGTH);
      fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", item_c);
      city_ptr = stack2_top;
      stack2_top = stack2_top->next;
      h1_Free(city_ptr);
      }

   fprintf(stderr, "\nEnd of list.\n");                    /* DEBUG */
   fclose(file_ptr);
</pre>

<P>As an aside, you could easily modify your program to cycle through the
list of cities and perform the intersections one at a time, printing out
the city name if the intersection was satisfied. For this operation, you
would use the <I>h7_PointLsetDist</I> function. This might be the technique of
choice if you wanted to see the world coastlines on your screen and have the
selected city locations highlighted with a brightly colored marker, one
at a time.

<P>Being a professional, you will finish your program by cleaning up your
work. You know that the compiler will look after the system stack space
management, but it is your job to free up any system heap space. For the
sample program this is really not required since you have no further work
to do and you are simply going to terminate execution, returning to the
operating system. If your program might some day be included as part of
a larger application, however, then proper clean up will be needed. This
is especially true if your program is to be incorporated by others in their
work.
<P>The termination of your program looks like this:<pre>
/* Release the Voronoi index and workspace.                         */
   h0_FreeVix(&vxd);
   h6_WorkspaceRelease(&wkd, workspace);
   fprintf(stdout, "\nEnd of Cities program.\n");
   return 0;
   }                                         /* end of main program */
</pre>

<P>Your program is complete. It should now be compiled, linked and run
in your own C/C++ language development environment.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>From the tutorial example, you have learned about some basic Hipparchus
functions that you will likely use in your Hipparchus-based applications.
These are:

<ul>
<li>initializing Hipparchus workspace
<li>specifying an ellipsoid parameter set
<li>establishing a Voronoi cell structure
<li>converting external coordinates
<li>managing stacks and queues
<li>constructing objects
<li>logically deriving new objects
<li>traversing the elements of an object
<li>releasing space occupied by an object.
</ul>

<P>Throughout the balance of the <I>Hipparchus Tutorial and Programmer's
Guide</I>, we will be introducing other important functions of Hipparchus.
