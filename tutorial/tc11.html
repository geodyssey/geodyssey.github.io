<h2>Chapter 11: Troubleshooting</h2>

<P><h3>Introduction</h3>

<P>The purpose of this chapter is to provide some advice on troubleshooting
your Hipparchus-based application. This chapter is not intended as a general
discussion on the art of debugging. You should refer to other sources for
general input on this important subject. C/C++ can be very demanding when
debugging, given all the freedom the languages allow (with pointers,
structures, functions, etc.). One good book on the subject is entitled <I>"C
Traps and Pitfalls"</I> by Andrew Koenig. See <I>Appendix C -
Bibliography</I>.

<P>One important item you must remember when developing your application
is that the <I>Hipparchus Library</I> functions perform little data checking.
For the sake of speed and efficiency, it is assumed that your application
will perform the edits and checks prior to passing information to any of
these functions.

<P>If you are working with a 16-bit version of Hipparchus, you must be
particularly alert to the possibility of 64K address wrap-around.

<P><h3>Tools</h3>

<P>There are several debugging tools provided with the <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK
that will help you when you are developing your applications. These tools
include the following:<ul>

<li>the on-line <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I> (HTML)<p>

<li>other on-line manuals such as the <i>Hipparchus Utility Guide</i><p>

<li>certain Hipparchus debug display functions<p>

<li>numerous C source utility and sample application programs that may be
compiled in the presence of your C/C++ source program browser.<p>
</ul>

<P>In addition, you may have access to other general debugging tools that may
be of significant assistance. For example, for complex applications you may
find it helpful to install one of the commercially available debugging
software packages and route its output to a second computer for display,
while your application is running. For the "how to" on these tools and
techniques, we will leave you to access your own technical support sources.

<P>The <I>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</I> is your primary source
of information on the specific use and application of the <I>Hipparchus
Library</I> and <I>Hipparchus Auxiliary Library</I> functions. For each
function, you have been supplied with the following:
<ul>
<li>descriptions of each of the arguments<p>

<li>description of the return type (if any)<p>

<li>explanation of the return values<p>

<li>tips on usage<p>

<li>references to other related functions.<p>
</ul>

<P>If you use the details provided in the Hipparchus headers,
you will have little difficulty in the proper syntactic usage of each of
the functions. In general, the primary challenge will be in learning the
semantics of each of the functions. And, as usual, much of your debugging
energy will be spent in resolving issues and irregularities with your data.
However, the latter will not likely be new to you and you will have your
own tools and approaches for this.

<P><h3>Debugging Functions</h3>

<P>Hipparchus contains a number of functions specifically designed for this
purpose. In general, we have assumed that most developers will have graphical
capability and will not be restricted to a text only capability.
Nevertheless, as a last resort, the <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK includes some tools
that operate at this level. The list includes the following functions that
output the points or vertices defining an object, in text format:
<ul>
<li><I>h0_DumpPset</I> - dump a point set object<p>

<li><I>h0_DumpLset</I> - dump a line set object<p>

<li><I>h0_DumpRset</I> - dump a region object<p>

<li><I>h0_DumpCoordinates</I> - dump a subset of differential coordinates.<p>
</ul>

<P>As mentioned, these functions would likely only be used as a last resort
during development. At a minimum, they illustrate how to traverse the
internal structures, should you have a need to do this.

<P><h3>Techniques</h3>

<P>The old technique of lacing your source code with <I>printf</I> statements
is still valid. But the text sent to your display can obliterate your graphic
results. Dual display environments and commercial debugging tools can be
more effective.

<P>If you have a second machine, you can use the economy technique. Simply
lace your application with <I>fprintf</I> statements sending the output
to a serial port using <I>stdaux</I>. For example:<pre>
  fprintf(stdaux, "Trace message here\n");</pre>

<P>Then, with appropriate pauses, you can trace the graphic generation on one
display and send the debug messages to another machine. You can do this using
a null modem cable and some simple communications software. The second
machine can then display the text messages in your <I>fprintf</I> statements.
This is a helpful technique if you do not have a debugger or if you are
concerned that your debugger might interfere with your graphical output.
Using this technique, you can reduce your environment to a more simple state.

<P>Sometimes, debugging can provide a solid justification for an advanced
GUI. With such a GUI, you can open a separate debug window and send the
<I>fprintf</I> output there while the application proceeds.

<P>In developing your source programs, a consistent standard of indentation
can also help. For source programs supplied with the <I>Hipparchus</I> SDK,
the following standards have been used:
<ol>
<li>Every opening brace is on the same line as the <I>do</I>, <I>while</I>,
<I>for</I>, <I>struct</I>, <I>union</I>, <I>enum</I>, <I>switch</I> or
<I>if</I> statement.<p>

<li>Every statement in the body is indented 3 spaces, as will be the
closing brace<p>

<li>Continuations are indented 1 space on the continued line<p>

<li>Single line statements are used for single statement <I>if</I> and
<I>else</I> blocks<p>

<li>Every closing brace occupies its own line<p>

<li>After a closing brace, subsequent statements will move 3 spaces to
the left.<p>
</ol>

<P>You may choose to follow a different standard. As long as you follow
a consistent approach, your debugging effort will be reduced.

<P>You will probably want to print off a copy of <I>hipparch.h</I> and the
other header files supplied with Hipparchus. The structure and type
definitions will be helpful in resolving inconsistent usage. Alternatively,
if you are debugging in an integrated development environment, you may be
able to make direct use its source code browser. Note that the on-line
<i>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</i> provides HTML extensive hyperlinks
to the header definitions for the majority of structures referenced by the
functions.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>

<P>We have assumed that you will have some experience with the art of
debugging.  Specific debugging commands are provided. The on-line HTML
<i>Hipparchus Library Reference Manual</i> provides extensive hyperlinked
cross-references between function and header specifications. The utilities
and sample applications provide additional examples and automated cross
references once compiled in the presence of a source browser.
