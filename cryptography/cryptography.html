<H3>Cryptography: Protecting your Geographic <small>(and other)</small> Data</H3>

<p>
In our ongoing explorations of the methods of cryptographic
protection of geographic location data we found <b>Bruce Schneier's
Blowfish</b> to be the preferred cryptographic algorithm on which to
base this protection. Its widespread use, small block size, speed
and simple API make it an ideal component for use in high-performance
database servers. However, the Blowfish C code published in
Dr. Dobbs Journal, September, 1995 was not re-entrant, a necessary
condition for use in multi-threaded database servers. Accordingly,
we modified the published Blowfish functions slightly to provide
re-entrancy. (For more about Blowfish, here's a link to
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html" target="_blank">
its description</a> on Bruce Schneier's company website).
</p>

<p>
To confirm the correct operation and performance of these functions,
we have prepared a <EM>general purpose</EM> multi-platform public-domain
file encryption/decryption utility, as well as a family of programs
intended to be used in conjunction with other applications (e-mail,
text editors, etc.) exchanging <EM>encrypted text</EM> via clipboard
in a format we call "textec".
</p>

<p>
To learn more about the <a href="textec.html">
<b>TEXTEC</b> family of programs</a> follow the link; the rest of this
page deals with our <b>file encryptor utility</b>. Unceremoniously called
<b>BURP</b> (for Blowfish Updated Re-entrant Project), it is a console
("command-line") program we use for protection of the archival data
storage and in our software and data distribution.
</p>

<p>
The <b>current</b> version of <b>BURP</b> is <b>v. 1.20</b>. It has
been ported to and tested on additional platforms and includes numerous
minor upgrades. However, the program output data format is the same
as it was in our original release version. Specifically, BURP
provides "<b>plausible deniability</b>": it produces "clean"
ciphertext files (i.e., there are no file headers, key verification
tokens, system, application or content identification strings, etc.).
Consequently, a file encrypted by BURP appears to consists entirely
of a random data stream - it <b>can not be easily detected or
"provably identified" as ciphertext</b>, as long as the key is secure,
or unless it is broken cryptographically.
</p>

<p>
You are invited to download and use this utility. Full cross-platform
<b>C language source</b> is provided. There are no restrictions on its
use and re-distribution (other than such general restrictions on the use
and/or distribution of strong cryptography that might or might not be
imposed by some jurisdictions on their residents).
</p>

<p>
BURP has been in continous use by a large and diverse group of
organizations and individuals since 1998. We expect and welcome
your comments on both its strength and functionality.

If you need only a <b>platform-specific executable</b>, you may be able
to use one of the binaries listed below. If you download and invoke
the program with no parameters, it will list on the console its
"use summary". A complete description of BURP's use and functionality
can be found in the <a href="burp.txt" target="_text">burp.txt</a> file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this set of binaries is provided primarily for the
convenience of recipients of our distributions. (We will gladly port
BURP to any platform not included below - and make it available for
public use - if we can be provided with temporary <i>ssh</i> shell access).
</p>

<p>
If you are encrypting your own data we strongly suggest that you download
the source, inspect it and compile the program. Depending on the
circumstances, it could be <b>extremely imprudent</b> to use any
cryptograpy that has not been built from the source code in your
possesion, inspected by you or someone you trust.

or where the plainetx is intended to be permanently kept
on a secured computer after the decryption.
