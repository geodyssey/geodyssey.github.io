<h2>Textec</h2>
<h4>Encrypted Text Format Specification and Tools</h4>

<p>
This Web-page is a working repository for a family of programs
which share a central feature: strong (128-bit) encryption of text
in a form (referred to as "<b>textec</b>" in this document) which
makes such text suitable for communication between different
application programs not necessarily designed to operate with
encrypted data, as well as for communication of protected text
between applications running on different operating systems and
on different hardware architectures. All core C language functions
- most notably those that perform <b>Blowfish</b> encryption and
decryption - are part of the source code collection posted here.
They have been rigorously tested on a large number of different
computer systems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Textec</b> is designed assuming a typical "unit" of protected
data consists mostly - but not entirely - of natural language text
and that its volume is what would be expected in a typical e-mail
message or a narrative record-element of a computerized database.
The encrypted text format attempts to be both simple and robust.
In particular, <b>textec</b> "by design" steers away from "tags",
"headers" or similar identifiers. Flexibility and simplicity have
been the primary design principles. Specifically, and in contrast
to MIME protocol and similar endeavors, <b>textec</b> design assumes
that in many instances the archival repository or communication
infrastructure system need not - indeed, there are good reasons
why it should not - know "too much" about the data it is handling.
</p>

<p>
<b>Textec</b> design also recognizes that in most real-life computer
applications the weakest link in the security chain lies not with
the strength (ill-understood as it might be) of the cryptographic
algorithm, but remains well hidden somewhere in the myriad number
of minor software engineering details that all large systems are
burdened with. If this view is correct, simplicity and isolation
of the code that participates in the "security chain" is an
important condition of system security. Users that (perhaps
legitimately) fear their opponent can cryptographically break the
algorithm used by <b>textec</b>, may as well view all current
cryptographic algorithms with equal scepticism and opt for
non-algorithmic security solutions (OTP, physical protection,
dedicated communication channels and so on).
</p>

<p>
So far, "the family" consists of the following members:
</p>

<table border valign="top">

<tr valign="top"><td><b>&nbsp; Encodex </b></td>
<td>Command-line program performing encryption.</td>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>&nbsp; Decodex </b></td>
<td>Command-line program performing decryption.</td>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>&nbsp; Notex </b></td>
<td>Windows text editor similar to Notepad.</td>

<tr valign="top"><td><b>&nbsp; Eudox </b></td>
<td>Eudora 3.x "plug-in" encryptor/decryptor.</td>

</table>

<p>
The current version of these programs is posted for testing
and feedback (please e-mail bug-reports to: support@geodyssey.com);
however, the format of <b>textec</b> is stable and is not expected to
change. Its details are documented in the preamble of the <b>Encodex</b>
(see below) program source code.
(View the<a href="textecspec.txt" target="_text"> relevant section</a>).
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Encodex and Decodex</h3>

<p>
Two "command line" utility programs (<b>Encodex</b> and
<b>Decodex</b>) for three selected platforms (Linux, Mac OS X and
Windows) provide the basic ability to encrypt and decrypt files
into and out of the <b>textec</b> format.

</p>

<p>
The complete C language source code of both programs is included here.
The primary reason for providing it is to have it inspected as widely
as possible, in order to ensure that it can be trusted.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, both programs can be simply recompiled on new platforms
in order to provide a quick ability to generate and process <b>textec</b>.
The code can also be "stitched into" any other application (e-mail,
text-processing, database, etc.) in order to give such application the
ability to encrypt, decrypt and exchange secure text with other
applications using the same format. There are no restrictions - this
can be done by the developers of both "proprietary" and
"open-source" systems, commercial or free. A small encrypted
text file, included here <a href="textectest.xtx" target="_text">(textectest.xtx)</a>,
can be used to confirm the correct operation of ported program.
Its key is "geodyssey" (without quotes).

<h3>Notex</h3>

<p>
<b>Notex</b> is a program very <b>similar to the Windows Notepad</b>
"applet". Using Windows "clipboard" it can exchange both clear and
encrypted text not only with the e-mail clients, but with a wide
variety of other text-processing applications running under the
Windows family of "desktop" OS-es (9x, ME, 2K, XP, etc).
</p>

<p>
<a href="notex.txt" target="_text">Read or save</a> preliminary
documentation (notex.txt).
</p>

<p>
<a href="win32/notex.exe">Download and/or test-run <b>Notex</b></a>
(notex.exe). The program requires no "installation" or
"configuration files". Your browser may let you <b>run Notex from</b>
its current location on <b>the 'net</b>. If this is the case, you can
use the clipboard to locally transfer the text to and from your
e-mail program window, and encrypt and decrypt e-mail without
any encryption software "installed" on your computer.
</p>

<p>
You can <b>test this</b> quickly by selecting and copying into
the clipboard the text displayed by your browser if you click on
<a href="textectest.xtx" target="_text">textectest.xtx</a>,
then starting notex.exe from the 'net and entering the password
[Crypto] - [Enter...Key...] (the password is "geodyssey", no quotes)
and decrypting the clipboard to the Notex text window
[Crypto] - [Decrypt Clipboard to Text].
</p>

<h3>Eudox</h3>

<p>
The same format of e-mail-friendly ciphertext is used by an Eudora
"plug-in" named <b>Eudox</b>. This plugin has been developed for
use with <b>Eudora 3.0.6</b>: the most popular and probably still
the best e-mail program for the Windows desktop. It has additionally
been tested with Eudora 4.3 and 5.0.
</p>

<p>
<a href="eudox.txt" target="_text">Read or save</a> brief documentation
(eudox.txt).
</p>

<p>
Download the eudox.dll file and simply copy it into the Eudora plug-in
directory (usually named "plugins"), no other "installation" is required.
Then run Eudora and first select [Tools] - [Eudox - Enter or Change Key]
to enter the encryption key. Once the key has been entered select
[Edit] - [Message-Plug-ins] and [Eudox encrypt] or [...decrypt]
on the main Eudora menu to encrypt or decrypt either the whole body
or only the selected (highlighted) part of an e-mail message in
the active message window.
