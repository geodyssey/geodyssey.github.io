<h3>Encrypted Zaurus backup</h3>

<p>
This document explains how to back up and restore the complete
operational environment of Zaurus PDA. The main advantage
over the backup/restore procedure supplied with the device
is that the <b>backup archive file is encrypted</b>. This
means that even if the data on the Zaurus must be carefully
guarded against any unauthorized access, there is no need
to guard the backup archive file: it may be, for instance,
stored and retrieved from any web-server using insecure,
public access or it may be burned on a CD without much
concern whose hands that CD might end up in sometime in
the future.
</p>

<p>
Another potentially useful feature of this procedure is
that the encryption program works "at both ends": on the Zaurus
<em>and</em> on the PC. This means that in an emergency (for
instance, if the Zaurus is lost or broken while travelling)
the backup archive can be decrypted and de-compressed on any PC.
Decrypted archive is a compressed 'tar' file well known to Linux
users; if the PC on which the backup archive is decrypted runs
Windows, 'tar' program for Win32 platforms can be obtained from
http://gnuwin.epfl.ch/ . Wading through the raw Zaurus
address-book file in XTML format on a PC might not be the most
elegant way to get an address or a phone number, but if it is
the <em>only</em> way, one would quickly find it quite tolerable.
</p>

<p>
The working components of the procedure explained herein
are the Burp encryption program for Zaurus and two shell scripts:
the first one to backup and the second to restore the device.
Both shell scripts are described in this document.
The "terminal" application must also be installed on the
Zaurus.
</p>

<p>
This procedure has been tested on Zaurus SL-5500 with
Sharp ROM, standard "terminal" application (from the CD
that comes with the Zaurus) and FAT-formatted MMC card.
It is expected to work with any ROM version and SD/MMC
card. Only minor modifications might be required if the backup
is stored on CF card. The following assumes that the "terminal"
application is installed on Zaurus and that files can
be transferred from the memory card to a PC and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>Quick overview</h3>

<p>
The steps you will have to carry out are:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Copy an appropriate binary of the encryption program
to Zaurus and, optionally, to the PC.</li>
<li>Create an archive directory on the MMC/SD card.</li>
<li>Create "save" and "restore" bash scripts.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Before you do any of the following, ensure you have an
up-to-date conventional backup and know how to restore
the Zaurus after performing a "hard reset".
</p>

<p>
Next, copy - using whatever method you normally use to
transfer files between PC and Zaurus - the Burp program
Zaurus binary from its <a href="cryptography.html">
web repository</a> to the /usr/bin directory on Zaurus.
Ensure that it is executable; if necessary consult Linux
chmod command documentation for details. Read Burp
documentation in (<a href="burp.txt">burp.txt</a> file)
and test it by ecrypting and decrypting some data files.
</p>

<p>
Using a text editor that writes clean ASCII text
files, create two files, one called "bkopenv" and the other
called "rstopenv". These names suggest "backup of operational
environment" and "restoration of operational environment".
You can change the names of these scripts, rename the
encryptor program and use a different name for the directory
where the archive will be stored, as long as you consistently
change all references to such names in everything that follows.
</p>

<p>
Copy both scripts to the same /usr/bin directory on Zaurus
and ensure they are likewise executable.
</p>

<p>The content of the first script ("bkopenv") file is:
</p>
<hr>
<b>
<code>
#!/bin/bash<br>
cd /<br>
<br>
tar -cf /tmp/xx_archive.tar home/*<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: tar failed"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>

gzip /tmp/xx_archive.tar<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: gzip failed"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>
<br>
burp -eo -c /tmp/xx_archive.tar.gz<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: burp failed or aborted"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>

mv /tmp/xx_archive.tar.gz /mnt/card/xx_dir/xx_archive.tar.gz.burp<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: can't move archive to SD card"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>

ls /mnt/card/xx_dir/.<br>
echo "User backup done"<br>
</code>
</b>
<hr>
<p>The content of the second script ("rstopenv") file is:
</p>
<hr>
<b>
<code>
#!/bin/bash<br>
cd /<br>
<br>
if [ ! -f /mnt/card/xx_dir/xx_archive.tar.gz.burp ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: no file [/mnt/card/xx_dir/xx_archive.tar.gz.burp]"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>
<br>
burp -d -c /mnt/card/xx_dir/xx_archive.tar.gz.burp /tmp/xx_archive.tar.gz<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: burp failed or aborted"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>
<br>
gunzip /tmp/xx_archive.tar.gz<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: unable to decompress"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>
<br>
tar -xf /tmp/xx_archive.tar<br>
if [ $? != 0 ] ; then<br>
   echo "Error: unable to restore"<br>
   exit 1<br>
fi<br>
<br>
rm  /tmp/xx_archive.tar<br>
echo "User restore done"<br>
</code>
</b>
<hr>

<p>
Once all three components are on the Zaurus, open the terminal
and create the backup directory on the SD/MMC card:<br>
<code>
mkdir /mnt/card/xx_dir<br>
</code>
</p>

<p>
You are now ready to backup the Zaurus - simply type "bkopenv"
at the bash prompt and supply the key or the passphrase when
Burp asks you to do so. Once the archive is created, copy it
from the archive directory on the SC/MMC card to the PC and
store it wherever you would store your important backup data.
Remember, the archive file is encrypted and you don't have to
worry who might get access to it - no matter how private and
sensitive the data you keep on your Zaurus is.
</p>

<p>
To restore the Zaurus from the archive, ensure the archive file
is in the backup directory on the SD/MMC card and run "rstopenv"
shell script. A word of caution: since the "terminal" application,
Burp program and restore script will not be present on Zaurus
if you were forced to perform "hard reset" (or if you are
restoring to a brand-new replacement Zaurus) it is a good practice
to keep a copy of Burp (Zaurus binary), restore shell script and
qpe-terminal...arm.ipk file wherewer you keep the archive itself.
Alternatively, you can prepare (and have handy) a conventional,
unencrypted backup set of Zaurus that has no user data, just the
terminal application installed and both Burp program and restore
script present in the /usr/bin directory.
</p>

<p>
Note that Burp does not verify the correctness of the decryption
key - this is intentional, as it provides for higher security.
Whatever key or passphrase you type, it will produce <em>some</em>
output; however, if the key was not the same as the one supplied
during the encryption, the process will fail in subsequent
decompression step.
</p>

<p>
<b>Finally, there are two things that can not be emphasized enough:
read the documentation in the <a href="burp.txt">burp.txt</a> file
and test this procedure thoroughly before you decide to depend on
it in an operational setting.</b>
