John began his career many years ago with IBM Canada, soon becoming their
first Senior Systems Engineer. While with IBM, John contributed to many
firsts: first computers for Statistics Canada, Revenue Canada, Environment
Canada, first IBM/360 outside the USA (National Research Council) and the
first GIS anywhere (Roger Tomlinson's Canada Land Inventory System).

<p>
With two other IBMers, John co-founded Systems Dimensions Limited, a
then-large-scale remote job entry computer center serving central and east
coast United States and Canada (IBM/360/85).  As VP Systems, he was
responsible for the design of the center and its initial products and created
the first repeatable multi-programming job accounting system (AccountPak). As
a director of SDL he saw it grow to over 500 people with offices in New York,
Boston and Washington as well as Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and
Quebec City.

Moving to Calgary in 1974, John was a systems consultant to Arctic Gas, a
Calgary-based initiative to construct a large-scale natural gas pipeline from
Alaska's North Slope and Canada's Beaufort Sea to connect with existing
Canadian and US carriers to the south.

<p>
In 1979, John and his family went sailing in their 50' cutter, visiting
points along the west coast of the USA and Mexico, learning celestial
navigation, diesel mechanics and ham radio along the way.

<p>
Returning to Calgary in 1982, John joined the Calgary Olympic Winter Games
Organizing Committee. As VP Systems and Planning and later as VP Technology
he had responsibility for the design and deployment of all computer systems,
timing, scoreboard, telephone, radio and cable television technology.

<p>
Following the successful 1988 Calgary Olympics, John moved to New Zealand to
provide NZ Telecom with overall project management of the deployment of their
integrated customer management systems complex (AS/400's).

<p>
Returning again to Calgary in 1991, John joined with Hrvoje Lukatela to form
Geodyssey Limited.

John is past national secretary of the Canadian Information Processing
Society, past president and an honorary life member of the Ottawa Flying
Club. </body> </html>
