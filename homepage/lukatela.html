<h1>Hrvoje Lukatela</h1>
<img src="lukatela.gif" alt="(Mugshot)">
Hrvoje is Chairman and Chief Scientist of <a href="index.html">Geodyssey
Limited</a>. He is also the creator of <a
href="../overview/overview.html">Hipparchus</a>.

<p> Hrvoje was born and educated in Croatia. He graduated in 1971 as a Survey
Engineer from the Faculty of Geodesy, University of Zagreb. <p> Soon after
graduation, Hrvoje joined IBM in Zagreb where he provided general systems
engineering services to IBM's customers, primarly in the area of scientific
and systems programming.

<p>
In Canada since 1973, Hrvoje worked for several engineering companies on
survey engineering, project management and technical computing projects.  One
notable project (MANOR) called for the development of the automatic
coordination library for the horizontal geodetic control adjustment program
for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Another interesting project
required field astronomy for the orientational tie with Mecca for the King
Abdulaziz University Jeddah campus layout.

<p>
Moving to Calgary in 1980, Hrvoje participated in the Alaska Highway pipeline
project with management responsibilities for engineering and project
management computer systems. Here he conceived and first implemented a novel
method for geo-referencing and processing high volumes of location-related
data.

<p>
In 1985, Hrvoje struck out on his own, consulting to Shell and other
organizations on matters relating to geometronics and the design of large
spatial databases. It was during this period that he crystallized the design
and initial implementations of Hipparchus.  Early implementations
incorporating these ideas were systems for AccuMap EnerData (Calgary) and
Environment Canada's Ice Centre (Ottawa).

<p>
In 1991, Hrvoje joined with John Russell to form <a
href="index.html">Geodyssey Limited</a>.

<p>
Hrvoje is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario
and the Canadian Cartographic Association.  He has published numerous papers
on the subject of computational geodesy and spatial databases, including the
definitive <a href="../papers/hlauto8.html"><i>"Hipparchus Geopositioning
Model: An Overview"</i>, AutoCarto/8, Baltimore, 1987</a>.
