<h2>UPDATE</h2>
[as of 2017-01-15]<p>
<b>
Geodyssey Limited of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has been voluntarily dissolved.
This website will be maintained for reference purposes only by Geodyssey's former principals.<p>

The current host is an informal non-redundant Ubuntu server. Consequently, you can
expect the occasional outage for routine maintenance.<p>

Welcome to our <b><i>ROUND</i></b> world!<p>

<b>First</b>, be assured that this site is 100% browser neutral, using NO browser scripting or any type of active content. Also, be assured that none of the downloadable Windows demo offerings cause or require formal Windows installation or registration.<p>

<b>Geodyssey</b> was the developer of
<large><B>Hipparchus</B></large><sup><small>&reg;</small></sup>,
<large><B>Galileo</B></large><sup><small>TM</small></sup> and
<large><B>Georama</B></large><sup><small>TM</small></sup>.<p>

<b>Exclusive rights to the Hipparchus Libraries were sold to Microsoft Corporation.  However, we continue to offer the two demo suites, Galileo and Georama, for free download.  We are maintaining this website content for reference purposes only.</b><p>

<B>Hipparchus</B>, <I>(the ancient Greek)</I>, invented latitudes
and longitudes and was the first to measure distances in terms of angles.<p>

<B>Hipparchus</B>, <I>(our product)</I>, was an <B>"open"</B> GIS toolkit
that enabled software developers to incorporate geography into their
applications. And yes, we too measured distances with angles, but not using
the familiar latitudes and longitudes. Instead, we work with <i>direction
cosines</i>. And from that true "paradigm shift" flows an unexpected
mathematical power and significant performance gain.<p>

Use of the <B>Hipparchus Library</B> of C language functions has permitted
the C/C++ language developer to deal with the "where" of things, without
requiring proprietary database management systems (DBMS's) or specific
graphical user interfaces (GUI's).<P>

Firmly grounded in the science of geodesy, <b>Hipparchus</b> combines the
speed and precision of 3D ellipsoidal vector algebra with a novel spatial
indexing scheme to provide seamless and lightning-fast geographic
functionality.<P>

<p>
<b>Hipparchus</b> has been in general use for more than twenty years. More
than 200 customer/developers in 27 countries have been using Hipparchus to
address the geographic aspect of their applications.

<HR><H2>About Geodyssey</H2>

Geodyssey was a private Alberta, Canada corporation funded exclusively through
the investment of its principals and the revenues from its technology sales.
Geodyssey was founded in 1992 by Hrvoje Lukatela and John Russell,
experienced survey engineering and computer systems technology managers,
respectively. In 1993, they were joined by Ron Gilmore, also an experienced
technology manager.<p>

It should be noted that Geodyssey developed the Hipparchus Technology and
brought it to market without the financial support of any government or
academic agency.<p>
