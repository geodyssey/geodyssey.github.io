This 'readme' file is likely to be found in a root directory
of a <b>CD with a collection of maps in .tgxm format</b>.
Look for additional readme.html file(s), co-resident with maps,
tipically in a directory named \<i>some-region-name</i>_tilesets.

<h2>TileShare System</h2>

<p>
TileShare is a set of programs and computer file
specifications for those that need to use
- and may want to share - large-scale paper
maps on personal and mobile computers. Once transformed
from their paper form into data files by scanning and processing,
such "maps" (called "<b>tilesets</b>") become cross-platform
entities that can be used (and shared) without change on many
different computers, in a variety of applications.
</p>

<p>
Following is a summary of the most important
characteristics of the tileset file format:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
A tileset map can be  used in memory-mapped mode
on computers having either "little-endian" or "big-endian"
atchitectures.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The tileset file format accommodates either lossy or lossless
compression of bitmaps, or a combination of both.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Tilesets can be used effectively on systems with very
little memory. Since the component tile spatial clustering is
based on the Morton Squares schema, fastest possible navigation
within large external files is assured.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Once a tileset has been assembled, all geopositioning and
navigational functions use only integer arithmetic.
Despite this, geometry computations are both global
in scope and of centimeter-range precision. The tileset file
format therefore is well suited for use in devices having
no floating-point hardware.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
TileShare system was developed by
<a href="http://geodyssey.github.io" target="geodyssey">
Geodyssey Limited</a> of Calgary, Alberta, Canada,
the developer and vendor of a comprehensive library of geographic
software tools. However, in the hope that it will
promote and facilitate wider sharing of scanned maps
between users and geographical computer applications,
all specifications and full source code presented
here are free for either personal or commercial use;
crediting Geodyssey Limited as the source is
appreciated but is not required.
</p>

<p>
TileShare components included on this CD include:
</p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>

<p>
Tileset file format specifications - of interest to the
application developers - are described in the extensive
commentary of the C language header file
<a href="./source/tileset.h">tileset.h</a>.
</p>

<p>
The complete TileShare Manual - of interest to both
tileset creators and users - can be viewed
<a href="./docs/tileshare.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Operation of all the programs listed below is explained</b>
in the "TileShare Programs"
<a href="./docs/tileshare.html#progs">
section</a> of the Manual.
</p>

<h4>Win32 programs</h4>

<p>
Following executable programs can be found in the
<b>\win32run</b> directory on this CD:
</p>

<p>
<b>viewtgxm</b> is a simple <b>Windows application for
viewing tilesets</b>. It can be used "as is" or as the basis
for Windows applications with a more comprehensive repertoire
of geographical functions. Alternatively, it may be used
as the model to quickly port basic tileset viewing and GPS
navigation capabilities to other computer hardware and/or
operating systems.
</p>

<p>
If you have a GPS device connected to your portable computer,
<b>viewtgxm</b> can center on your location and trace your
movements. To do so, you first start a program called
<b>gpsmonitor</b>, which can serve any number of <b>viewtgxm</b>
display windows with the positional information required to
center on, and subsequently trace your current position.
(It can also create a time/position log file). <b>gpsmonitor</b>
is configured via a simple ASCII text ".init" file - to be
found in the same directory as the gpsmonitor program.
</p>

<p>
<b>tscomp</b> is a command-line program that "compiles" (assembles)
one or several scanned map "sections" into a tileset.
</p>

<p>
<b>bmpreg</b> is a simple GUI applet that will measure
pixel coordinates of a raw map scan section. It can be used
to simplify the preparation of section-definition files.
</p>

<p>
<b>widthcals</b> is a command-line program that will calculate
and report desired combinations of tile width in pixels and
the number of tile columns, based on the pixels per unit of
longitude of the scanned bitmap and the longitude range of
the tileset.
</p>

<p>
<b>gridder</b> is a command line program that can be used to
process maps with no latitude/longitude grid, but with four
points, each in the general vicinity of one map sheet corner,
for which the latitude and longitude are either known or can
be measured with a GPS device.
</p>



<h4>A Tileset Building Example</h4>

<p>
By way of an example, there is a collection of four files
in the <b>\example</b> directory on this CD:
<code>louise150_a.bmp</code> and <code>louise150_b.bmp</code>
are two raw scans of a small part of Canadian 1:50K
topographic map 82 N/8, covering Lake Louise, Plain of the
Six Glaciers and Valley of the Ten Peaks in Banff National
Park, Alberta. <code>louise150.sdef</code> is the textual
specification file, used - in addition to the two .bmp files -
to produce <code>lake_louise.tgxm</code>: finished tileset of
the Bow Range (one of the most outstanding and yet easily
accessible destinations in the Canadian Rockies).
</p>

<h4>C language source code</h4>

<p>
As mentioned in the introduction, an extensive collection
of source code is provided to those that intend to develop
TileShare applications. Source code is provided with
extensive commentary and addresses all of the essential steps
required to create and use tileset files. It is organized
in two directories:
</p>

<p>
The first directory is <b>\source</b>. It contains cross-platform
fundamentals: a header file that defines tileset file structures,
their order of occurrence and their elements and C language code
for a library of computational and indexing functions.
</p>

<p>
The second directory is <b>\win32source</b>. It contains all of
the source-code components for (previously introduced)
<b>viewtgxm</b> and <b>gpsmonitor</b> programs.
