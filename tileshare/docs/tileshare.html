<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
TileShare is a system for those that need to use and may want to share
scanned large-scale paper maps for use on personal or mobile computers.
</p>

<p>
The TileShare system design assumes that a map is scanned once, and used
many times, on computers of differing architectures, by many different users,
in different applications. The format of the file in which a scanned map is
stored is 'open', so that any programmer can create applications that
facilitate the scanning of paper maps as well as the applications that
view such maps, facilitate navigation by them or capture location data
from them. Each scanned and "compiled" map file (a file with the extension
".tgxm") contains all of the information required to use it, so that it
can be easily exchanged between users of TileShare based systems (via
computer media, over the 'net, etc.). The internal format of tgxm files
is very efficient, much more so than raw scanned bitmaps. Even when they
cover large areas (and thus produce large disk files), such files can be
used on hand-held systems having very little memory. This is achieved by
"tiling" the scanned bitmaps and compressing their pixel data on a tile
by tile basis. Thus such files are referred to as "tilesets".
</p>

<p>
The creation of tilesets consists of three steps: scanning the paper map
sheet - usually in more than one "section", then specifying the position
of the scanned sections on the face of the Earth and finally specifying
the characteristics of the desired tileset. Such definitions are contained
in a simple text file, described in detail below. Finally, both the scanned
bitmap files that contribute to a single tileset and the specification
text file are processed in a "bitmap compilation" step to produce a single
tileset (.tgxm) file.
</p>

<a name="create">

<h2>Creating Tilesets: Rules and Assumptions</h2>

<p>
The following is preliminary, in point form for the benefit of beta
testers. Later, more advanced tileset compilers might dispose of some of
the limitations stated below. In particular, a more sophisticated compiler
will not require the scans to be "North up" and would be more flexible
in the number and placement of the registration points.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
The system is assumed to be used for maps of relatively large scale;
typically between 1:25K and 1:250K, and not for high latitude locations.
(Stereographic projection tilesets, better suited for polar regions, will
be implemented later.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Tilesets are assumed to be in the WGS 1984 datum. If the source map
sheet is not in the this datum, adjustments must be made in specifying
the coordinates of the registration points. In such cases, the
latitude/longitude grid (if any) as depicted on the scanned bitmap
may not coincide with the grid drawn over the bitmaps by the viewer
program.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is also assumed that a single tileset might be obtained by scanning
more than one map sheet, but that its extent on the ground is not to exceed
a few hundred kilometers in latitude, and significantly less than a
hemisphere in longitude. (An extent specification of more than 20 degrees
in latitude or 120 degrees in longitude is treated as an error.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Scanned material must be "North up". There must be exactly four
"registration points" per scanned section/file; placed in the general
vicinity of the four corners of the scanned section. The ground area
covered by each scanned section is assumed to be considerably larger than
the ground area of a tile.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
File names must be ASCII and must not contain blanks. Assume that the
case of the letters is not material, i.e., that (some of) the systems on
which a tileset will be used will not be able to distinguish between
"SantaAna" and "santaana". The first letter of any name must be alphabetic
(26 letter latin alphabet), followed by up to 31 letters, numerals or "_"
(underscore). The material processed and produced by this system may be
used on multiple computing platforms, therefore the best approach is to
restrict tileset file names to lowercase letters only.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Input scans must be in the .bmp format, either rgb (24-bit) color or
256 palette based colors.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Specification file lines must not end with a backslash ("\").
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<a name="scanning">

<h2>Scanning a Map Sheet</h2>

<p>
Scanned sections must be (for now) .bmp files with 24-bit or 8-bit
color depth. Best results are obtained if the scanning is done at
such resolution that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
input section and final tile-set pixels. This will, of course never
be the case, if even the smallest geometry re-adjustment is necessary,
as is, for all practical purposes, almost always the case. Still,
if the correspondence is close, only "single-pixel discontinuities"
will occur and these will be quite distant from each other and
hopefully barely noticeable in the final tileset. Since tile width
must be a multiple of 8, it will be required to find a particular
combination of tile width, number of tile columns and longitude range
of the tileset to achieve this. Since the tile height is given, but
number of rows and unused space at the top and bottom required to
accommodate the latitude range is calculated by the tileset compiler,
no such consideration needs to be given to the tile height and number
of tile rows.
</p>

<h2>Compiling a Tileset (using the tscomp.exe program)</h2>

<p>
Graphically, the process can be depicted as follows:

</p>

<a name="scale">

<h3>Output Scale Determination</h3>

<p>
The scale of the output tileset should be such that the bitmap, observed
on the computer screen, is of the same or slightly larger scale than the
scale of the source paper map; note however that we assume that the tileset
will be used on a variety of screens with somewhat different resolutions.
Therefore the scale determination is an exercise in compromise and reasonable
anticipation of the conditions in which the tileset will be used.
</p>

<p>
It is first worth noting that there are two values which must be given
explicitly in the specification file: the width of the output tile (measured
in pixels) and the longitude range of the final tileset. Thus the scale of
the output tileset is determined by a third value: the number of tile
columns. This value may either be given explicitly, or it might be left to
the tileset compiler program to calculate it. (See also above, under
"Scanning a Map Sheet").
</p>

<p>
If the number of columns <i>is not</i> given, two other values <i>must</i>
be given: the scale of the original paper map and the resolution at which it
was scanned. Using these values - and various internal assumptions - the
program will compute and report the number of columns. If the scale of the
resulting tileset is too small (e.g., the map on the screen is hard to use
because the detail is too tiny) then the number of tile columns can be
increased and the compilation run repeated. Conversely, if the map on the
screen is more detailed than required, the number of tile columns could be
reduced, and the compilation re-run.
</p>

<p>
The scanned material can also be distributed in "raw scan" form, together
with the specification file. The end user can then adjust the scale (by
experimenting with the number of columns setting) to generate a tileset that
is best suited to his or her screen resolution and viewing preferences.
</p>

<h3>Scan and Tileset Specification File</h3>

<p>
The tileset specification file is an ascii text file with a suggested
extension of .sdef. It consists of a number of directives in the form:
<pre>keyword=data</pre>and any number of comment lines, starting with ";" in
column 1. Both input- and output-describing directives are placed in a single
file. Their order is immaterial.

<h2>TileShare Programs</h2>

<a name="tgxmview">
<h3>Tgxmview and Gpsmonitor Programs</h3>

<p>
<b>tgxmview.exe</b> is a "bare-bones" reference implementation of
the program to view and use tilesets on a Windows computer optionally
equipped with a GPS device transmitting NMEA sentences into one of
its COM ports. The program needs no "installation" on the computer
it is to be run on and requires no "configuration options" to be
specified. It can be placed in the directory of the user's choice
or it can be run from a CD (where it is, presumably, co-resident
with a collection of tilesets). It can be initiated with the name
of the selected tileset on its command line, or its [File] menu
entry can be used to select and open the tileset to be viewed.
Any number of instances of this program can execute simultaneously,
displaying the same or different tileset files. The navigation
around the tileset can be done either with the horizontal (East-West)
and vertical (North-South) slide-bars, or by left-clicking on the
desired map center-point. Right-clicking on a map point
will display both its ground and tileset coordinates.
</p>

<p>
<b>GPS tracing:</b> In addition to the tgxmview program, the
distribution contains a program called <b>gpsmonitor.exe</b>.
This program enables GPS communication with the viewer(s). Only
one instance of this program should be started at any one time.
The program is configured at start-up time by an ASCII textfile
named gpsmonitor.init, which, incidentally, must be co-resident
with the gpsmonitor executable. The distribution copy of the .init
file contains extensive comments regarding its content. There are,
however, only two lines that most users would need to change:
the specific COM port to which the GPS device is connected and
the path and name of an optional log file. If the values in the
CD distribution copy of the .init file (COM1 and no logging)
need to be changed, both the gpsmonitor.exe and gpsmonitor.init
must first be copied to a writeable hard drive; the .init file
so that it can be modified, and the .exe file so that it remains
co-resident with the .init file.
</p>

<p>
Once the gpsmonitor is up and running, a number (up to an
implementation-defined maximum) of currently running instances
of tgxmview.exe can request that gpsmonitor forwards its ongoing
location information, in real time, as it is received from the
GPS device. Once the option is activated within any of the viewers,
a GPS trace can be displayed and its window can be set to move
over its designated tileset so that the current position stays
within its window.
</p>

<p>
If a fully qualified name of a log file is specified, gpsmonitor
will open the file in "append" mode and will write to it a
location/time record whenever such data is received from the
GPS device (typically, every second). The format and content of
the location/time record can be found in the gpsmonitor.c source
code file.
</p>

<p>
Please note that all tilesets are assumed to be cast in the
WGS84 datum. Thus, if the GPS device allows the selection of the
datum, please ensure that this is the setting in effect.
(If there are no datum options offered, then almost certainly
this will be datum used by the device.)
</p>

<a name="bmpreg">

<h3>Bmpreg Program</h3>

<p>
<b>bmpreg.exe</b> is a simple Win32 GUI program that displays
Windows .bmp files and allows the measurement of pixel coordinates.
(The program has no menu of its own: file selection entry is
incorporated into its "system" menu - activated by clicking on
the icon at the left extreme of its title bar). Clicking with
the left mouse button anywhere on the bitmap image displays the
coordinates and at the same time loads the number strings into
the Windows clipboard. If Notepad (or any similar text editor)
is used to compose an .sdef file, the coordinates of registration
points can be included in it without the need to re-type them.
</p>

<a name="widthcalc">

<h3>Widthcalc Program</h3>

<p>
<b>widthcalc.exe</b> is a command line program that will list
possible combinations of tile widths and number of tile columns,
sorted by the measure of their fit to the tile longitude range.
It is invoked with six command line parameters, as follows:
</p>

<code>
<pre>
px_s_w  px_s_e  long_s_w  long_s_e  long_t_w  long_t_e
</pre>
</code>

<p>
px_s_w and px_s_e are pixel X coordinates and long_s_w and long_s_e
are longitudes (in the same format as the angular values in the .sdef
file) of two points at the same or somewhat similar latitude on a single
scanned section; probably of the two points used as the West and East
section corner points along the North or South edge of a scanned
section. These four values define the number of pixels per unit of
longitude of the original scanned bitmap.
</p>

<p>
The two parameters that follow - long_t_w long_t_e - are the longitudes
of the West and East limit of the tileset. With these known, the program
will find the total number of columns required for each tile width
between 80 and 512 pixels. (Tile widths must be multiples of 8).
In the general case, the number of columns times the tile width will
not equal the number of pixels that the tileset should ideally have,
based on the pixel per unit of longitude value computed from the first
four parameters and the longitude range defined by the last two parameters.
The results will be sorted on the absolute value of the difference and
printed on the standard output. From these, a tile width and number of
columns can be selected such that the tile width is close to the desired
value, but still having a reasonably close fit to the total pixel number.
</p>

<a name="gridder">

<h3>Gridder Program</h3>

<p>
<b>gridder.exe</b> is a command line program that can be used when
the source paper map (to be scanned) contains no latitude/longitude grid.
In such a case, an arbitrary grid (or tick-marks) may exist, or may be
drawn on the map surface, so that each scanned section of the map has
four near-corner points that can be readily identified on the raw
scanned section file. The latitude and longitude of these points can
be determined as follows:
</p>


<p>
First, four points near the corners of the entire map sheet must be
identified and their coordinates determined - perhaps by visiting them
in the field and taking a reading from a GPS device. (We will refer to
these points by NE, NW, SE, SW - according to the map corner they occupy).
</p>

<p>
Next, all six distances between the four points are measured on the map.
Then a text file is created containing the known coordinates and
measured distances. Its format is as follows:
</p>

<code>
<pre>
; comment describing the map or the project
 latitude-NW longitude-NW
 latitude-NE longitude-NE
 latitude-SE longitude-SE
 latitude-SW longitude-SW
;
 r-NW r-NE
 r-SW r-SE
 r-NW r-SW
 r-NW r-SE
 r-NE r-SW
 r-NE r-SE
</pre>
</code>

<p>
latitude-NW, longitude-NW ... (etc.) are geographic coordinates of the
four given points, in the order prescribed, and in the same format as
the angular values in an .sdef file.
</p>


<p>
Lines such as 'r-NW r-NE' specify the distance between the given points
NW and NE - presented such that the first value is the lower and the
second the higher reading on a metric ruler joining the two points.
(The order of points can of course be reversed, just so long as the
first of the two values is numerically lower than the second). Both
readings are real numbers, being meters and fractions thereof, most
commonly consisting of four digits, assuming a tenth of a millimeter
precision, the millimeters probably read directly and their tenths
'eye-balled'. (Note that the program will work no matter what units
are used to measure the map, but since the ground distances are
computed internally in meters, the scale value as reported by the
program may have to be adjusted when compared to the published map
scale).
</p>

<p>
The resulting file is submitted to the program by providing its name
as the command-line parameter. The program will report (on the standard
output) a composite scale - calculated as the mean of the ratio of six
distances computed from the geographic coordinates and their equivalents
measured on the map.
</p>

<p>
If the map is of relatively large scale, and if the field coordinates
have been determined correctly, and if the distances on the map have
been measured with adequate precision, the scale should be very close
to the scale printed on the map, and the six values that follow should
be commensurate with the precision with which distances have been
measured on the map: they are the differences between the measured
distances and the scaled-down computed ground distances.
</p>

<p>
Next, all distances from scan-section corner ticks - however many
are required to divide the map sheet into sections that will fit on
the scanner - and four control points are measured. The text file is
appended with lines that look as follows (note the order of values):
</p>

<code>
<pre>
 ptID r-PT r-NW r-PT r-NE r-PT r-SE r-PT r-SE
</pre>
</code>

<p>
ptID is simply a short string mnemonic which is included in the
output line so that the point for which the coordinates are computed
and printed can readily be identified in the output. What follows on
the text line (one for each point for which the latitude and longitude
is to be computed) are eight readings, giving four distances: from the
point to each of the four control points. (The low/high reading pair
format is similar to the control distance input mentioned above - note
that four r-PT readings on one line will be different as the ruler is
aligned along the point and each of the four given points in turn).
</p>

<p>
When this file is processed by the program it will repeat the output
described above (mean scale and control distance differentials), to
which it will append one line for each point, consisting of:
</p>

<code>
<pre>
 ptID latitude-PT longitude-PT  d-NW d-NE d-SW d-SE  sigma
</pre>
</code>

<p>
ptID identifies the point and latitude-PT and longitude-PT are its
geographic coordinates. Four values that follow are differences
between measured and computed distances, scaled down to the map, in
the same order as the distances given. Again, if everything was done
correctly, the differences should be similar in magnitude and
commensurate with the precision of the measurements. The last value
is the computed 'sigma' (mean error) - it provides an indication of
the precision (on the map) with which the coordinates have been
determined. This would be expected to be in (sub)millimeter range;
higher as the map scale becomes smaller and the precision of the
control point coordinate determination and map distance measurement
decreases.
</p>

<p>
The output from <b>gridder.exe</b> can be re-directed to a text file,
from which the numeric coordinate strings can be "cut-and-pasted"
into the editor used to compose the .sdef file.
