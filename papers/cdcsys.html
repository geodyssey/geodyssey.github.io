<h3>Abstract</h3>
</center>

<p>Latitude and longitude are traditional measures by which
a spatial direction of the ellipsoid normal - and thus a
location of a point on the Earth's surface - is both deterimed
and defined numerically. This numeric definition is therefore
directly related to classicall positional measurement, but it
is particularly ill-suited to computations on a digital computer.
For such use, normal is best represented in vector form, using
three direction cosines as the numbers representing point
coordinates. This coordinate notation can be transformed into
a particular two-number form, called here "compact direction
cosines". This paper explores the characteristics and utility
of such coordinates.

Representation of the physical surface of the Earth in digital
systems is a subject of considerable current attention. As the area of
the coverage of such systems increases, it becomes necessary to provide
methods to model very large, continuous surface conglomerates in a manner
which does not violate the surface integrity (i.e., which does not impose
hard partitioning as an artifact of the digital model), but, at the same
time, provides an efficient spatial index to a small section of the surface
of transient interest.
