GIV allows geologists, other scientists, teachers, students and the
general public to view, combine and analyze geologic data on an inexpensive PC
with little or no training.  GIV uses simple straight forward data formats and
color theory to graph and display any type of geologic data.  Map data tends
to be the most pervasive for geologic use and most useful to non geologists so
it gets the most attention.  Maps, however, are only part of GIV and should
not be considered to be what GIV is.  GIV is unique because it is unconcerned
with data format, uses color as a coordinate system, works well on an
inexpensive PC, does just about anything, is cheap to build and run, and anyone
can learn to do it.
</p>

<p>
GIV is based on the fact that writing your own programs to answer simple
questions is not only not bad, but it can be faster than using a package, will
allow you to do any analysis you understand, helps you understand what you do,
and allows you to analyze a surprising amount of data.  Even if they never
plan to program, scientists should know how to program in order to know when
to program, when to have someone else program for them, when to buy a program,
and how to evaluate programs they buy.
</p>

<p>
GIV now consists of a small set of USGS programs that can quickly turn a
paper map into a computer displayable map, display and manipulate a variety of
image types, combine maps with images and text in a variety of ways, and
integrate just about any type of data display.  GIV is easy to use, easy to
learn to use, completely owned by USGS, and will run on any PC that has a
color display.  A complete set of hardware to run the entire suite of software
costs less that $2000 and total training time to run the total program set is
less than a week.  GIV is scale and  projection independent and is moving
towards platform independence.
</p>

<p>
GIV is not a system, but rather, it is an attempt to give control of
science back to the scientist.  GIV is in part a set of functions that allow a
scientist to control data display and analysis.  More importantly, GIV is a
philosophy that it possible to start at the bottom with very simple tools and
quickly build fairly complex data processing machines to work with any type of
data.  Moreover, it is possible to learn how to do this even if computer
programming is not a strong skill possessed by the scientist.
</p>

<p>
Graphing and displaying data is one of the primary ways in which scientists
understand the masses of data with which they work.  Before data can
be used they must be understood, and to do  this a mental model of the data
must be constructed.  Many times this is achieved by simplifying, sorting and
graphing the data in various ways.  The current way of analyzing data involves
getting the data out of the system where it resides, finding and procuring
software (and sometimes hardware) to read and process the data, learning to
use the software, then finally processing the data.  Each step of the process
can take weeks, months or even years and, if the choice of software is
incorrect, results will be disappointing.
</p>

<p>
Scientists who have a PC on their desk and a grasp of just about any
computer language can build a simple program set to answer the questions that
need to be answered in a few days to a few weeks.  If the programs that did
the work are thrown away and never used again there can still be a large
savings in time and money over finding, procuring and learning to use
commercial software.   Also, if the scientist writes the code to solve the
problem, any test can be tried on the data rather than only those tests
contained in the software.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that one should always write one's own programs -- this
would be just a limiting as the current "never write your own programs"
philosophy.  One should become familiar enough with programing to know how
simple or complex a program must be to solve a problem.  Only then can a
knowledgeable decision be made as to how to proceed.
</p>

<p>
After FORTRAN the thought was that what was needed was higher level
programing languages.  GIS (geographic information system) packages and
systems are a type of high level programing  language.  They allow the user to
do large tasks and to assemble the results into complex geographic outputs
which can be combined in various ways to answer questions.  The problem with
these systems is that they are complex to operate, require long learning
curves, and create data format problems when more than one system is used.
The most successful computer language of late is C, which is much lower level
language than FORTRAN.  It is possible that for many applications what is
needed is lower level not higher level languages.  C is a good box of crayons
for drawing graphs on a computer.  GIS is not very competitive with a C
compiler in the hands someone who wants to use it.
</p>

<p>
We make CD-ROMs of USGS data and on each disc we put software to display
the data contained on the disc.  The software has no other purpose than to
display specific data and to display it quickly and easily on any type of PC
with a color monitor.  Each program was written from scratch with no more than
a week or two spent developing any program.  After the software is written for
a disc the aut hor reviews it and decides what else it should do,usually by
saying "Gee, wouldn't it be nice if ..." and the '...' are added to the
program as new features.  As the number of specialized programs grew the
functions they performed began to duplicate each other and libraries of
functions became grouped into a few sets.  We now can create programs using
these libraries in a few hours and we can modify any part of a libraryto do
any additional task we wish.  The current state of GIV, which is placed on
each CD-ROM as they are produced, is due to this process being used over and
over.
</p>

<p>
The important point is not that we have the libraries, but that one person
built them in two years while turning out programs that worked. These programs
are published as CD-ROM discs.  Almost anyone could duplicate this effort if
they tried, but they are prevented from doing it by cliches such as 'you're
reinventing the wheel' or 'GIS is a complex subject that is best left to the
experts'.  Neither of these cliches is correct.  The invention of the wheel
did not put wheelwrights out of business, rather it created their craft.
Geographic information is relatively easy to use, but GIS's tend to complicate
the process.  Because GIS's are written to do everything for everybody, they
can be difficult to use and require a long time to learn to use.
</p>

<p>
GIV, if correctly used, is unconcerned with data format because a simple
program can usually be written in a matter of minutes to convert almost any
data to an ASCII format that GIV can use.  GIV uses ASCII flat files as one
form of data input and output for all applications.  ASCII flat files are also
used to control the programs to minimize the need for software changes.
The data and control files can be created, checked and edited with any text
editor.  All earth locations are in decimal latitude and longitude.  Each file
contains a small group of like information and there are many files with names
that describe their contents.  The entire program set is designed for the PC
user who does  not have a lot of time to learn to use complicated software but
wants to do some mapping to solve a problem.
</p>

<p>
One final point about GIV that distinguishes it from GIS is the use of
color.  A color image is a 5-dimensional graph that is useful for displaying
all types of information.  The five dimensions are 2 locational (x and y) and
3 color (red, green and blue or intensity, hue and saturation).  If you learn
a little color theory it is quite easy to use color to graph data, and the
current programs that make up GIV use color theory to a great extent.  You do
not need to understand color theory to use these programs but you will need to
learn something about it if you wish to create your own.  If you want to learn
color theory contact the Rochester Institute of Technology where you will find
the most knowledgeable color experts in the country.

<p>
Before the computer science was learned with the slide rule and graph
paper.  The reason for the graph paper was to simplify and visualize complex
concepts.  There were graphs in the books and on the chalk boards, but drawing
your own graphs helped you to understand what is going on.  It was not the
graph itself but the construction of it that gave the insight.  Now that we
have replaced the slide rule and graph paper with the computer there seems to
be an all pervasive philosophy of let others do your graphing for you and just
look at the results.  Nowhere is this philosophy more prevalent than in
geographic information.
</p>

<p>
Getting back to the simple truths about learning and  understanding
science, we scientists need to draw graphs.  What we had to work with in the
past was basically a 2-dimensional graph of points on an x,y plane.  Several
lines could be drawn on the same graph but they were all 2-dimensional.
Attempts to make 3-dimensional graphs where limited and consisted mainly of
contouring.  With color monitors on computers we now have three more dimensions
to work with namely red, green and blue.  If we use these dimensions
correctly we can draw and analyze 5-dimensional graphs.
</p>

<p>
The thought that image analysis and geographic information analysis are
complex subjects better left to the experts is not universally true.  Drawing
a map is as simple as connecting dots much as we did when we where 5 years old
in the 'follow-the-dots' book, but we use a function called 'plot_line' in a
computer rather than a crayon.  OEMG has developed and implemented, with
some success, a simple to use and understand program set of data visualization
tools which is a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach.  We started out
with the expressed purpose of writing specific software to display a single
set of data and ended up building a small program set that was data independent.
</p>

<p>
When we started writing software for CD-ROM publication we specifically
said that we would not do data base management nor would we do any data
analysis.  As it worked out the process of displaying data does all of the
management functions required to present a clean, accurate, readily accessible
data bases.  Moreover, it is not the computer that does the analysis, it is
the scientist;  by displaying these data in various ways to the scientist, we
provided the tools necessary to do the analysis.  The group of programs that
resulted do a very limited number of operations, but they are the operations
our scientists need and they work with the data we have.
</p>

<p>
You could take these programs and learn to use them to display data.  This
is not, however, the intent of this exercise.  The intent of the exercise is
to show the average scientists that mapping and image processing are not as
difficult as they might think and that there are times when it is both quicker
and cheaper to do the job yourself than to find a system to do it for you.
Image processing and graphics consists only of placing any color dot any where
on the screen and reading the screen to find out what color dot is there.
Mapping is using graphics to connect latitude and longitude dots to make
lines, and to fill in areas with colors and patterns to make maps.  You can
use our functions to do this if you know C or you can write your own.  Either
way will free you from the bonds of complex software and data format
incompatibilities.
</p>

<p>
There are several shocks when we begin a project with a visiting scientist
who has not worked with us before.  Data format is totally irrelevant, scale
and projection have little or no meaning, just about anything can be done, and
most importantly, the computer screen is not a piece of paper.  We write our
own code to do simple tasks and make things appear on the screen.  The hard
part is figuring out what you want on the screen -- getting it there is much
easier.  We frequently say that we ar long on answers but short on questions.
</p>

<p>
Because we are writing our own code we will transform whatever format we
get to one we need in a matter of hours at most.  If we need a new format we
will make it while keeping to the primary rules of GIV -- keep in simple and
keep it small.  Flat ASCII files of one thing or closely related things with
names that tell what's in them are best.  We can convert these to binary files
which can be quickly processed by our programs and convert the binary back to
ASCII as we need to.  People read ASCII, and computers read binary.  You need
both and they should be easily transferred from one state to the other.
</p>

<p>
A map scale and a map projection only have meaning for a paper map.  If
all data are in decimal latitude and longitude there is no reason to limit the
scale or projection.  All GIV programs handle a number of projections and
users can switch between them as they see fit.  Scale is important to some
extent to tell the user the relative accuracy of the input data, which usually
came from a paper map.  However, the input scale of the data is usually
obvious to the user as one zooms in and the lines become jagged with widely
spaced points connected by straight lines.
</p>

<p>
Paper maps are static while computer programs are dynamic.  In an atlas
each page is fixed in size and content so maps tend to be divided into
sections.  In a computer you can zoom into any region and quickly create a
screen sized map.  The borders of sub maps become irrelevant to the user
looking for a feature on the larger map.  Also overlays such a roads, streams,
place names, etc. can be added as needed in any combination the user wishes.
Colors can be changed, flashed or areas measured at will.  Any map on the
screen can be output to some standard file format for printing at any scale
desired.  Scales and projections can be changed as desired and other data can
be added from data files, paper maps or drawn right on the screen.  Icons can
be placed on the maps to mark objects and the icons can be used to locate text
files, graphs or images.  By choosing an icon the user can read  information
about it, see pictures of the location, or view graphs of data.  All of this
is quite easy to do with GIV, usually taking less than a day to make any
application work.
</p>

<p>
Because GIV is not a system there is currently little documentation and it
changes quite often.  We are keeping it backwards compatible, but some
programs become obsolete as other programs take over their functions.  We do
not guarantee that it works perfectly since we only use it for limited
operations.  We do, however, constantly fix things which we find to be broken
and the latest version cost just as much as the first -- its free.  We place
every piece of software we use to make the disc on the disc in all forms
needed to repeat the production process.  Source code, object code and
executable files are included as are all support and data files.
</p>

<p>
GIV is designed for the amateur who wants to do something quickly with a
gentle learning curve yet not be limited by software if complex analysis is
needed.  What the average PC programer needs are simple to understand data in
small clearly identified files.  Large complex data sets which contain
interrelated data of many types are difficult to work with and frequently
impossible to decode.  A scientist should not be forced to study cryptography
in order to do their job.  Very often I describe my position as the OEMG
cryptographer because much of what I do is to get simple data out of complex
formats that are frequently undocumented, or incorrectly documented.
</p>

<p>
Much of what we do is concerned with mapping.  Mapping is not necessarily
the primary science involved, but the data need to be displayed, at least in
part, on a map of some sort.  To create a map that contains all of the
information necessary to answer any of the questions a map can answer you need
only a set of vectors (lines with attributes) and, if the vectors make
polygons, you need to have at least one point inside of each polygon with the
polygon's attribute.  Other files which mark places, things, etc. can be added
after the base map is done.  The GIV package allows you to do all of this
quickly and easily on a simple PC.
</p>

<p>
The GIV imaging capability now includes conversion of 24-bit color images
to 8-bit images which look like 24-bit images, mapping vectors and point data
over images, creation of arbitrary image planes into color images, eigen
vector rotation of up to 10 image planes, 3-dimensional colorsurface displays,
and 5-dimensional color vector data displays.
</p>

<p>
Other GIV functions include time series display and analysis and seismic
segment display.  The time series display application is of current meter
data.  The programs allow graphing of temperature and current vectors as well
as spectral analysis of velocity.  Maps are used to locate available stations
and all other parameters can be used to limit the data sets you wish to work
with.
</p>

<p>
The seismic display can show complete segments of any size on the screen
and allows zooming into the segment to show detail at any level needed.  The
traces are linked to surface position by maps on the screen and trace numbers
which can be located in latitude and longitude position files.  All that is
needed to input data to the programs is a seg-y data file and a paper (or
computer generated vector) map of the shot points.
