Following is a set of html directives and restrictions used for
the publishing of "collections" of "chapters", "papers" or
"articles", when such collections are to be distributed as both
"web-pages", and as a stand-alone computer-media resident
publications (on floppy disks, CD's, etc.). Such "publications"
are read using "web-browser" programs (for example Mosaic,
NetscapeNavigator, InternetExplorer, Opera, etc.) This text
assumes that the reader is familiar with the essentials of the
operating system independent computer file systems and with the
basics of web publishing (html, bit-mapped graphics).
</p>

<p>
One such "collection" can be thought of as the equivalent of
one "bound volume" in the paper world (book, technical manual,
magazine, conference proceedings...).  In further text it will be
referred to as a "book". As already stated, a book is assumed to
consist of "articles". It is further assumed that multiple books
will reside and be distributed on a single computer disk. This
document assumes that there will be one "decision-maker" (person or
institution) that acts as a "book publisher" and a (possibly large)
number of others that are considered "article authors".

<p>
This document addresses two principal issues: how to make more than
one such book co-resident on a single disk, and how to internally
organize a book, so that the manipulation of the material on a
computer is as simple as possible, and can be "read" using as wide
a range of computers and browsers as practical.

<p>
One book is completely contained in a single, "flat" directory.
("Flat" means there are no subdirectories). The name of the book
is a directory name, and it consists of lower-case letters, numbers
and the underscore ("_") character, with the total count of less
than 64. The starting character must be a letter. This standard does
not control the book name space - which means it provides no rules
that would guarantee such names would be unique. However, if the
names are as complete and as descriptive as the names of the paper
publications commonly are, and if they end with the publication date
in 'yyyymmdd' form, the likelihood of name collision will be greatly
reduced.

<p>
A book consists of a "table of contents", and "articles". Since all
book content is assumed to be read in a browser, the table of contents
will be an index.html file. The book publisher will assign a unique
string, starting with a lower case letter, of up to 16 characters,
conforming to a file-base-name convention, to each article. This string
will be referred as "article name". (Note, however, that the reader
will not normally see this name). Each file that "belongs" to an article
has a file base name which starts with the "article name". Similar to
the directory names, file name are strings of less than 64 characters.
Unlike directory (or book) names, file  names will include exactly one
period (".") character; separating the file base name from the extension.
Each article will have one file whose name consists of the article name
and an ".html" extension: this is the html file that will be linked to
the html "hypertext reference" from the article title in the book table
of content (index.html file).

<p>
This completes the set of rules that this "standard" specifies. However,
the book publisher will usually add additional rules which the article
authors are expected to follow. The purpose of such rules would be to
ensure that, for instance, all articles can be read on a given level of
browsers, that there is some guaranteed level of service in either
web or media distribution, that all articles follow the same typography
and presentation style, and so on. What follows is an example of such
rules for article author(s):

<ol>

<li>
<p>
All file names will be unique, starting with the article name.
Files must be of one of the following types (defined by their extensions):
.html, .gif, .png and .jpeg . There will be one file named artclname.html
(where artclname stands for the article name assigned by the book
publisher); this file will be the main text content of the article in
the form of an html document. It will be the only file with META tags,
and it will have a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag which gives a full title of
the article. The article title will also appear as an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
header, all other headers within the document (if any) will be of lower
(<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> etc.) levels.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
An article can have at most 8 .html files and at most 16 graphical
files, totaling no more than 50 KB for all .html files combined, and
no more than 200 KB of combined graphical (.gif, .png, and .jpeg) files.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Html constructs used must conform to the 3.2 level. Standard html
(UNIX-like) line endings are preferred. There are further restrictions,
as noted below.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Individual image size must not exceed 400 pixels in any dimension
(width or height). .gif or (preferably) .png file format will be used
for vector (computer generated) graphics, .jpeg for "dense-field"
(photographs, etc.) graphics. .gif and .png files must use "web-safe"
<a href="webcolors.html" TARGET="colors"><small>("WEBCOLORS")</small></a>
palette. All images must include a meaningful description in an ALT tag.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Hypertext references which are internal to the article can be
"implicit" in the text and must use relative URL's; external
references must be clearly described as net URL's in the text, and
must be absolute URL's.  Internal references may not open a separate
browser window; external ones must.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Following html features must not be used: background color control;
background graphics; sound; link appearance modification; browser
window size or margin control; text-in-graphics; frames; server-side
processing of any kind (CGI etc.); forms; plug-ins; java,
java-script VB-script or style sheets; <code>&lt;font&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;font-size&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>
tags and text color control.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Following html features are tolerated but discouraged: more than
one .html file per article; animated .giff's; mail links; client-side
imagemaps and paragraph or header indentation or justification control.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Finally, it is suggested to the article authors to test their
documents with browsers that put a great deal of emphasis on enforcing
the html standard and that restrict the functionality in order to
improve loading speed and responsivness. Under Win32 operating systems
this can be done with Opera (http://www.operasoftware.com/); under
Unices with GNU Help Browser or similar. Such browsers will often
demonstrate html errors even in instances that are quietly
(but sometimes inconsistently) tolerated by mainstream browsers.
