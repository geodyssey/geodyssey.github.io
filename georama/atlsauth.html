<h3>Introduction</h3></a><p>

This publication describes how you can use the <i>Georama Atlas Author's
Kit</i> to customize <i>Georama</i>.<p>

The <i>Georama Atlas Author's Kit (AAK)</i> is a complementary companion to
the <i>Georama for Windows 95</i> CD-ROM and is designed for use by
non-programmers.<p>

It's purpose is to enable the extension of both the form and content of
Georama.<p>

Although not requiring programming skills, some familiarity with the
operation of personal computers in the Windows 95, Windows 98 or NT
operating environments is required.<p>

The topics covered by this manual are introduced in their order of
complexity. This is so that the easier Atlas authoring tasks may be
accomplished without having to read and understand how to do the harder
tasks.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="start"> <h3>Getting Started</h3>

To extend Georama, you must first insert your Georama CD-ROM and review the
extensive on-line Help topics. If you wish, you can print them in two sets:
the main explanation and the reference material.  This on-line Help
document will be your principal reference.<p>

Specifically, you must review and understand the sub-topic "Making
Modifications", which may be found under the general Help topic
"Customizing". Here you will find instructions regarding options for the
rendering of features, many of which you may require for your custom-authored
Atlas. In particular, you should note the referenced Help topics that define
the specifications for the various control files.<p>

Assuming that you have set up Georama for at least partial hard disk
operation, your next step should be to unzip to hard disk the
<i>georama.zip</i> file contained on the
distribution diskette "Hipparchus Development Tools Release 3.1 Georama for
Windows 95". You may safely unzip this file into whatever directory was
chosen for the original Georama (for example, C:\GEORAMA). Be sure to unzip
this file with its directory sub-structure preserved (the -d option if
unzipping using the command-line version of PKUNZIP supplied).<p>

Since several components of the <i>georama.zip</i> file are updates to
similarily-named components copied from the CD-ROM, you will need to
authorize their substitution for their predecessors. The updates to the
Georama program suite are relatively minor.  Features added or changed are
described in this manual in the context of specific topics.<p>

The essential new elements supplied by the <i>georama.zip</i> file are the
<i>Hipparchus Utilities</i> compiled for Win32 console platforms, namely
Windows 95, 98 and NT4+. These executables together with the updated HTML
publication <i>Hipparchus Utilities Guide</i> (and this publication) will be
found in the RUNW32 sub-directory of your Georama directory. Since the
<i>Georama Atlas Author's Kit</i> is designed for use by non-programmers,
no source programs are supplied.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="change">
<h3>Changing Existing Scenes</h3>

Many simple changes may be made to Scenes without any of the tools or
techniques described subsequently in this <i>Guide</i>. To change the look
of an existing feature, you need only read and apply the instructions
contained in the <i>Georama for Windows 95</i> on-line Help.  Look for the
sub-topic "Making Modifications" (found under "Customizing"). Here you
will find out how to change style items such as line widths, point marker
symbols or color. You will also find out how to change the map scales at
which features appear or disappear.<p>

Using these instructions and a simple editor such as NotePad you can
construct new Scenes combining feature content of existing Scenes. To
do this you start by making a copy of one of the existing Scenes,
co-locating it in the same Atlas directory and giving it a new Scene-name
(ending of course with the .scn extension). Next, using the cut, copy and
paste facilities of your editor, you build and save the new Scene. The
next time you open the Atlas in Georama, you will be presented with the
new Scene as an option to open.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="addgps">
<h3>Adding GPS Data to Scenes</h3></a><p>

If you own a GPS receiver, you will have by now discovered how to hook it
up to your laptop computer and use the two together to record GPS map
traces of your travels. In this section, we describe how you can edit such
traces and add them permanently to the Scenes of any Atlas.<p>

When you began each GPS trace session, you specified the name of a file to
receive the GPS coordinates. (With the updated Georama, you can ask that
the coordinates to be <i>appended</i> to a previous trace session file).
GPS trace files are usually located in one of your private working
directories, or, by default, in the Windows temp directory. They are
usually identified by the filename extension <i>.gtr</i>.<p>

GPS trace files contain the raw ASCII records passed to the laptop by the
GPS receiver. These records are in a specific NMEA format. They are
retained in this format by Georama so that they can be used later to drive
a home base computer with simulated GPS input, replaying a trip just
taken.<p>

Before these GPS trace files can be set up for permanent display in
Georama, they must first be processed through a supplied filter program
called <i>gtr2lns.exe</i>. This program may be found in the RUNW32
sub-directory of your hard disk GEORAMA directory.  It is a simple Win32
command line program that should be run from a Windows MS-DOS box
(window).<p>

To run <i>gtr2lns</i>, open the MS-DOS box and change
directories to the hard disk directory containing Georama, like
this:<b><pre>
C:
\GEORAMA </b></pre><p>

Next run the <i>gtr2lns</i> program, like this:<b><pre>
runw32\gtr2lns  \Mystuff\mytrip.gtr  \Mystuff\mytrip.lns
</b></pre>

Note: For a list of the command line options, enter:<b><pre>
runw32\gtr2lns /h
</b></pre><p>

You now have a formal Hipparchus line set object, suitable for further
processing for inclusion into one of the Georama Atlases, like this:<b><pre>
runw32\lns2plr \Mystuff\mytrip.lns  World\mytrip.plr /v=World\worldw32.vix
</b></pre>

Note: For a list of the command line options, enter:<b><pre>
runw32\lns2plr /h
</b></pre><p>

Next, you must make this file known to Georama by entering a line into
the Atlas control file for the Atlas you are modifying. Edit the file named
<i>atlas-name.atl</i> (e.g., <i>World.atl</i>). Locate the section
heading:<b><pre>
[themes]
</b></pre>
and add a line, like this:<b><pre>
mytrip=lines,mytrip.plr
</b></pre>
then save the Atlas control file.<p>

Now you can modify one or more Scenes of the Atlas to display
<i>mytrip</i>. Edit each <i>scene-name.scn</i> file, locate the section
heading:<b><pre>
[content]
</b></pre>
enter a line similar to this:<b><pre>
mytrip=c17w2
</b></pre>
and save the file. Note that this control file may have been copied to your
hard disk as a "read-only" file, and will first need to be enabled for
modification.<p>

The net effect of all of the above is that <i>mytrip</i> will now appear in
any of the modified Scenes as a magenta line of width 2, at all scales.  Of
course, you can easily choose other rendering options.<p>

Be aware that the <i>.lns</i> file is simply an ordered collection of ASCII
latitude-longitude coordinates that may be freely modified using any text
editor. The file is also importable into the <i>Galileo for Windows 95</i>
GIS developer's workbench program.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="adddat"> <h3>Adding Data for New Features</h3></a><p>

Georama features data consists of vector coordinate elements and associated
data (if any) such as place names, elevations, earthquake magnitudes or
whatever.<p>

In order to achieve the required storage densities, access speeds and
rendering efficiencies, this data must first be processed into one or
more files of proprietary format. The <i>Georama Atlas Author's Kit</i>
supplies Win32 console utilities for this purpose.<p>

These programs will be found in the RUNW32 sub-directory of your hard disk
GEORAMA directory.  They are simple Win32 command line programs that should
be run from a Windows MS-DOS box (window).<p>

For instance, to run <i>pts2plr</i>, open the MS-DOS box and change
directories to the hard disk directory containing Georama, like
this:<b><pre>
C:
\GEORAMA </b></pre><p>

Next run the <i>pts2plr</i> program, like this:<b><pre>
runw32\pts2plr  \Mystuff\mypts.pts  World\mypts.plr /v=World\Worldw32.vix
</b></pre>

Note: For a list of command line options, enter:<b><pre>
runw32\pts2plr /h
</b></pre><p>

Once processed and placed in an Atlas directory, new feature data may be
referenced in a Scene control file (<i>scene-name.scn</i>) via specifications
in an Atlas control file (<i>atlas-name.atl</i>). (This process will be
described momentarily).<p>

Access to feature data is read-only via C run-time library stream I/O
facilities. No other file access facilities are used.<p>

Spatial coordinate data for use in Georama may be represented in any of six
basic formats, depending on its dimensionality and semantics of use.<p>

Spatial coordinate files may represent collections of independent objects or
canonical Hipparchus objects, being single sets of related elements.
Coordinate data collections are known as <b>plr</b> files (for points, lines
or regions) while coordinate set objects are known as <b>hbo</b> files (for
Hipparchus binary object).<p>

Points collections are created using the <i>pts2plr</i> utility.<br>
Lines collections are created using the <i>lns2plr</i> utility.<br>
Regions collections are created using the <i>rgn2plr</i> utility.<p>

Point set objects are created using the <i>pts2hbo</i> utility.<br>
Line set objects are created using the <i>lns2hbo</i> utility.<br>
Region objects are created using the <i>rgn2hbo</i> utility.<p>

Point or vertex coordinates are converted from geographical (ellipsoidal
latitude longitude) form to a proprietary internal form, differentially
related to the cells of a specific Voronoi cell structure.  Each Atlas has
its own Voronoi index structure.<p>

In any of the above file types, numerical data associated directly with the
coordinates of each point or vertex may optionally be carried forward into
the file. However, in all but the points collection, such numeric data is
not accessible by Georama.  For points collections, numeric data may be
interpreted by algorithms built in for the purpose, but currently limited
to an interpreter of coded earthquake data.<p>

Any textual data associated with the individual points of a points collection
may be disassociated from the coordinates and stored in a related text file.
Pointers into that file are then directly associated with the point
coordinates.  Optionally, an alphabetically ordered index file may be created
for use by Georama's gazetteer facilities.<p>

Input to the conversion utilities is in the form of files of related point
or vertex latitude longitude pairs expressed as ASCII text lines.  The
format for latitudes and longitudes is flexible with respect to form and
precision. For a list of sample acceptable coordinate pairs, see the
"geometry" sidebar in Georama's on-line Help.<p>

Marker records containing an asterisk in column one set off the individual
lines of lines collections or sets or the individual rings of regions.
Asterisk markers back to back mark the end of a lines collection or region
or the individual regions of a regions collection.<p>

Operation of these data conversion utilities is detailed in the supplied
publication, <a href="utility.htm"><i>Hipparchus Utilities Guide</i></a>.

To use the converted files in Georama, you must make them known to Georama by
entering a line into the Atlas control file for the Atlas you are modifying.
Edit the file named <i>atlas-name.atl</i> (e.g., <i>World.atl</i>). Locate
the section heading:<b><pre> [themes] </b></pre> and add a line, like
this:<b><pre> mypts=points,mypts.plr </b></pre> then save the Atlas control
file.  Note that these control files may have been copied to your hard disk
as "read-only" files, and will first need to be enabled for modification.<p>

Now you can modify one or more Scenes of the Atlas to display
<i>mypts</i>. Edit each <i>scene-name.scn</i> file, locate the section
heading:<b><pre>
[content]
</b></pre>
enter a line similar to this:<b><pre>
mypts=c13m11
</b></pre>
and save the file.<p>

The net effect of all of the above is that <i>mypts</i> will now appear in
any of the modified Scenes as a bright red house symbol, at all scales.  Of
course, you can easily choose other rendering options.<p>

Inspection of the existing Atlas and Scene files will reveal useful
techniques for rendering different density material at differing scales.<p>

Note also the entries in the supplied Atlas and Scene control files that
pertain to the Georama Inspect and Gazetteer menu options.  You may wish to
provide similar functionality for your own data.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="addatl"> <h3>Adding a New Atlas</h3></a><p>

Adding a new Atlas is very simple.<p>

First you must establish a subdirectory for the Atlas, on the same
directory level as other Atlas directories. This will be the container for
an Atlas control file, Scene control files, the Voronoi index and other
control files. These may best be set up by using as templates existing
control files.<p>

Finally, you must list the new Atlas by name in the overall Georama control
file, <i>georama.gin</i>.  Note that this control file may have been copied
to your hard disk as a "read-only" file, and will first need to be enabled
for modification.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="addvix"> <h3>Adding a New Voronoi Index</h3></a><p>

If the main body of data for a new Atlas is geographically distributed
similarly to the data for the supplied World or USA Atlases, you can simply
copy one of the existing Voronoi indexes into the new Atlas directory.<p>

However, if the main body of data for the new Atlas is regional, or
distributed significantly differently from the existing indexes, you should
consider creating a new Voronoi index for its data.  When preparing your new
data collections (<i>plr</i>'s) or Hipparchus binary objects (<i>hbo</i>'s)
for use with Georama, you will create them in the context of the new index,
(see <a href="#adddat">Adding Other Data Features</a>, above).<p>

There are a number of Hipparchus utility programs supplied for this purpose.
These are described in detail in the supplied publication, <a
href="utility.htm">Hipparchus Utilities Guide</a>.  In addition, Geodyssey
offers a number of prebuilt Voronoi indexes that provide coverage at
different densities and for other parts of the world. These may be reviewed
and freely downloaded from <a
href="http://www.geodyssey.com/cells/voronoi.htm">our web repository</a>.<p>

Note that in addition to the Voronoi index files supplied with Georama and
through the catalog, several are supplied with Galileo, including
<i>ISOTYPE.VIX</i>, which you may safely use as a starting index. You can
freely download Galileo (and these files) from
<b>http://www.geodyssey.com</b>.

Another alternative to creating a custom Voronoi index yourself is to let
Geodyssey do it for you!  We can also assist with the building of your new
PLR data collections or Hipparchus Binary Objects.  In cases where you are
unsure of the format of your source data, this might be the most
cost-effective route. Just call or e-mail us for a quotation.<p>

<hr><a name="licensing">
<h3>Licensing for Distribution</h3>

You will have noted from the face of the distribution envelope that the
Atlas Author's Kit carries with it an assignable single-chair
developer/user license.  This means that one copy of the Atlas Author's Kit
may be made for backup and retained on hard disk for ease of access,
including access over a network.

If on completion of your Atlas authoring tasks you wish to undertake a
multi-user physical distribution of our combined works, you should consider
these alternatives:<p> <ol> <li>distribution of your work as a separate
add-in to our Georama for Windows CD-ROM product, which your customers may
acquire directly from Geodyssey Limited or from yourself or others under a
discounted reseller agreement with Geodyssey.<p> <li>distribution of your
work and Georama as an integrated new CD-ROM product, with a modest royalty
payable to Geodyssey on the basis of the volume of distribution.<p> </ol>

In either case, Geodyssey will be happy to negotiate a fair agreement.<p>

<p>Go to <a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a>.<p>


<hr><a name="advanced"> <h3>Advanced Requirements</h3></a><p>

Your functional requirements for the customization of Georama may not be
entirely satisfied by application of the procedures described so far.<p>

If that is the case, you should consider several additional alternatives
that can quickly yield the desired results.<p>

First, if you have C/C++ Windows programming skills, you can acquire our
standard Hipparchus Software Developer's Kit (SDK) and proceed to modify
the supplied Georama source code, linking with the supplied <i>Hipparchus
Library</i> (binaries). Georama is written in ANSI C and communicates with
Windows 95 using the standard native Win32 Aplication Programmer's
Interface(API). No tools other than the C compiler are required to
regenerate and modify Georama.<p>

Alternatively, if you lack access to the required programming skills, you
might contract with Geodyssey Limited to prepare the required version of
Georama. Owing to our in-depth familiarity with the code, this process may
well be the most cost effective.<p>

In either case, any multi-user distribution of the resulting product will
be subject to a one-time Hipparchus Technology Distribution License. See
<href="http://www.geodyssey.com/licenses.htm">Hipparchus Technology
Licensing Policies and Prices</a>.<p>
